display_name=Delete blocks
short_description=Removes blocks from a legacy screen, based on presentation attributes or block position. | To simplify and speed up the process time of other rules, removing useless blocks can be an option. It limits the quantity of generated XML data and optimizes network traffic. \n\
By default, the rule is created with the {{Produit/Fonction}}Type{{-Produit/Fonction}} property set to {{Computer}}[^field]{{-Computer}}, meaning that the rule does not apply to blocks of {{Computer}}field{{-Computer}} type. \n\
The {{Reference}}Delete blocks{{-Reference}} extraction rule is also useful for cleaning up purposes when creating Data integration projects. Data to be kept are tagged using {{Reference}}XML Tagname{{-Reference}} extraction rules, tables are tagged using a {{Reference}}Table{{-Reference}} or {{Reference}}Subfile{{-Reference}} extraction rule, and other resulting blocks are tagged as {{Computer}}block{{-Computer}}. They can then be removed by configuring the {{Produit/Fonction}}Tag name{{-Produit/Fonction}} property to {{Computer}}block{{-Computer}}.\n\
The {{Reference}}Delete blocks{{-Reference}} extraction rule can also be used to remove portions of a screen not to be displayed (in webization projects). 
property.blockTag.display_name=Tag name
property.blockTag.short_description=Defines the tag name of blocks to be removed.
property.lenght.display_name=Length
property.lenght.short_description=Defines the length of blocks (without trailing and ending spaces) to be removed. | {{Computer}}-1{{-Computer}} means an unspecified length (the length criterion is not used), {{Computer}}0{{-Computer}} means that all blocks containing only spaces are deleted.
property.regularExpression.display_name=Content
property.regularExpression.short_description=Defines the regular expression matching the content of block(s) to be removed. | Blocks which content corresponds to this regular expression are removed. For example, if set to {{Computer}}TEST{{-Computer}}, all blocks containing "TEST" are removed.\n\
