display_name=Screen class exit handler
short_description=Defines a screen class exit handler. | A {{Reference}}handler{{-Reference}} is similar to a {{Computer}}Function{{-Computer}} except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} is a handler associated with the exit from a screen class event. It is executed when Convertigo detects the screen class corresponding to this {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}}, after having executed the extraction rules associated with this screen class.\n\
In other words, a {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} is executed when leaving the screen class associated with this handler.\n\
Notes: \
***A {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} contains other statements that define the actions to be performed on this screen class. It can return a result value ({{Computer}}accumulate{{-Computer}} by default as it is an exit handler).\
***{{Reference}}Screen class exit handlers{{-Reference}} can only be added to a transaction, one {{Reference}}Screen class exit handler{{-Reference}} for each screen class per transaction.
