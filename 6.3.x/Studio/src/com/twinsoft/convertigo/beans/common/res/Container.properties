display_name=Container
short_description=Defines a container block grouping blocks together. | The {{Reference}}Container{{-Reference}} extraction rule groups XML elements with same characteristics under a unique container XML element. This container element can be processed by a specific user-defined XSL style sheet. \n\
For example, buttons webized via the {{Reference}}Command{{-Reference}} extraction rule can be grouped as a menu and moved where required, or labels and fields composing a form can be grouped together and displayed in a frame.
property.tagName.display_name=XML tag
property.tagName.short_description=Defines the container element XML tag name (default: {{Computer}}container{{-Computer}}). | In order to be processed by XSL template rule, this element should have a specific tag name. This property allows to configure the XML tag name of the created element.
property.containerDesc.display_name=Container layout
property.containerDesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone in which the container has to be displayed. | This property allows to move the created container element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes. \n\
The screen area is defined through four coordinates: \
***x (area left corner), \
***y (area upper corner), \
***w (area width), \
***h (area height). \n\
All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). {{Computer}}-1{{-Computer}} represents an undefined value. \n\
These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the container.
