display_name=Default block factory
short_description=The block factory is the process that splits legacy screens into elementary blocks. | For extraction purpose, legacy application screens are broken into elementary entities called {{Computer}}blocks{{-Computer}}. The process in charge of generating blocks is called {{Reference}}Default block factory{{-Reference}}. \n\
The block generation process can be divided into three major steps:\
***The block factory analyses screen lines.\
***For each line, the block factory extracts character strings having same attributes (text color, background color, bold, blinking...).\
***For each character string having same attributes, the block factory breaks sentences into single words by performing a separation on blank spaces. For example, the sentence {{Computer}}the_nice_hat{{-Computer}} (where "_" represents a blank space) is divided into five blocks: {{Computer}}the{{-Computer}}, {{Computer}}_{{-Computer}}, {{Computer}}nice{{-Computer}}, {{Computer}}_{{-Computer}} and {{Computer}}hat{{-Computer}}. Consecutive blank spaces are grouped into one single block.
