display_name=Move blocks
short_description=Moves blocks in a legacy screen. | The {{Reference}}Move blocks{{-Reference}} extraction rule moves blocks extracted from a legacy screen to a different target position in the screen (defined through the {{Produit/Fonction}}Moving layout{{-Produit/Fonction}} property). 
property.fielddesc.display_name=Moving layout
property.fielddesc.short_description=Defines the target screen zone for moved blocks. | This property allows to position the moved blocks to a specific area of the screen. The moved blocks will be updated with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes. \n\
The screen area is defined through four coordinates: \
***x (area left corner), \
***y (area upper corner), \
***w (area width), \
***h (area height). \n\
All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). {{Computer}}-1{{-Computer}} represents an undefined value. \n\
These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the blocks.
property.isrelative.display_name=Relative move
property.isrelative.short_description=Defines whether the move is relative to the original blocks position or not relative. | If set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, blocks are moved from their original position to a number of columns and a number of lines from it.
