display_name=Separator
short_description=Defines how separators are materialized in legacy screens. | The {{Reference}}Separator{{-Reference}} extraction rule defines character strings to be considered as separators. It searches the screen for strings made of the same character, like series of "minus" signs ( "----" ), or of underscores ( "____" ).\n\
Characters considered as separators are listed in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Separators{{-Produit/Fonction}} extraction rule property. The rule matches strings only if they contain at least the number of occurrences (set as value of the {{Produit/Fonction}}Minimum number of occurrences{{-Produit/Fonction}} property) in one of the specified delimiters.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} ***The separator element has only one new attribute, {{Computer}}width{{-Computer}}, which represents the length of the separator, that is to say the number of separator characters in the separator string.\
***XML elements of the {{Computer}}separator{{-Computer}} type are handled by the {{Computer}}separator{{-Computer}} XSL template described in the {{Computer}}separator.xsl{{-Computer}} file. To change the way separators are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
