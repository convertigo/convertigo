display_name=Split block
short_description=Splits blocks depending on defined delimiter characters. | The {{Reference}}Split block{{-Reference}} extraction rule allows splitting a block into parts, breaking blocks including a specified delimiter character into smaller ones. This can be useful when other rules need separate blocks to be properly processed.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}}***The {{Reference}}Split block{{-Reference}} extraction rule can match any text on a green screen.\
***This rule does not add or create new attributes. Resulting blocks inherit most of the attributes from the original splitted block. Only position attributes (i.e. column and line) are updated to match actual position on the screen.\
***Since this rule does not create a new block type, it does not involve any specific XSL stylesheet. 
property.keepDelimiters.display_name=Keep delimiters
property.keepDelimiters.short_description=Defines if delimiters should remain included in generated sub-blocks. | If set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, delimiter characters are kept upon splitting, remaining as new blocks of size 1. Otherwise, delimiter characters are discarded. 
property.delimiters.display_name=Delimiters
property.delimiters.short_description=Defines a concatenated list of delimiter characters. | Caution: Default value for this parameter is a blank space (not easily visible). When setting a new {{Reference}}Split block{{-Reference}} rule, make sure to delete this default space before adding new delimiter character(s).
