display_name=Variable
short_description=Defines a JavaScript variable containing data extracted from a Web page. | The {{Reference}}Variable{{-Reference}} extraction rule extracts a list of nodes from the Web page DOM and sets a JavaScript variable in the current executed transaction JavaScript scope. This variable contains a {{Computer}}Java NodeList{{-Computer}} object, i.e. a list of XML nodes, extracted from the HTML page thanks to the execution of an Xpath on the page DOM. This Xpath is defined in {{Produit/Fonction}}Xpath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property.\n\
The variable is named after the name of the extraction rule, as set in the Convertigo studio. It exists while the transaction is running.\n\
If only one node matches, the variable is also a {{Computer}}NodeList{{-Computer}} containing only one {{Computer}}Node{{-Computer}} (index is 0). If no node matches, the variable is not created in the current executed transaction JavaScript scope (JavaScript "{{Computer}}undefined{{-Computer}}"). \n\
This extraction rule doesn't append anything to the transaction output DOM.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} ***The variable contains a list of node elements of the DOM. To access one element ({{Computer}}Node{{-Computer}}) of the list, use the following syntax in a statement: {{Computer}}var_name.item(index){{-Computer}}.\
*** To access one element's text content ({{Computer}}String{{-Computer}}), use the {{Computer}}element.getTextContent(){{-Computer}} method, to retrieve the text of the element, or the {{Computer}}element.getNodeValue(){{-Computer}} method, which result depends on the node type.
