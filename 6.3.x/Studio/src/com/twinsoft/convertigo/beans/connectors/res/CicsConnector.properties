display_name=CICS connector
short_description=Establishes connections with a CICS application. | A CICS Transaction Gateway can host several servers running different applications. In a CICS application, the display and business logics are usually managed in distinct programs. \n\
Programs exchange input and output data through a memory pool called COMMAREA (COMMON AREA). The COMMAREA is usually mapped by a definition of COBOL data included in communicating programs. This definition can be stored in two ways:\
*** built in the source code of the CICS program,\
*** stored in a separate file, called {{Computer}}copybook{{-Computer}}, that is copied when compiling.\n\
From a Convertigo point of view, a {{Reference}}CICS connector{{-Reference}} represents a gateway server.
