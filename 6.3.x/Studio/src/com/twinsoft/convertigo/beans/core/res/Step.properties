display_name=Step
short_description=Defines a step. | Steps are the building blocks of sequences. Each step:\
***has its own functionality,\
***uses data from sources,\
***produces XML data that can be used as sources by other steps. 
#property.tagName.display_name=Tag name
#property.tagName.short_description=Defines the name of the XML tag generated in the resulting XML.
property.isEnabled.display_name=Is active
property.isEnabled.short_description=Defines whether the step is active.
property.output.display_name=Output
property.output.short_description=Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML. | Set this property to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}} to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.\n\
Setting this property to {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}} does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
property.schemaDataType.display_name=Schema data type
property.schemaDataType.short_description=Defines which data type the step generates. | This property is filled with a schema data type name, which definition is known by Convertigo.\n\
The property value is to be selected among a list of values that is dynamically created with standard schema types (for example {{Computer}}xsd:string{{-Computer}}, {{Computer}}xsd:int{{-Computer}}, etc.) and with the project's schema types (for example the schemas of data output by transactions or sequences and the schemas of data generated by each extraction rule).
