property.mashupEventName.display_name=Mashup event
property.mashupEventName.short_description=Defines mashup events dispatched on click. | Mashup events can be of two types:\
***Calling directly a transaction or a sequence in Convertigo, \
***Launching an event in Mashup Composer.\n\
{{Produit/Fonction}}Mashup event{{-Produit/Fonction}} property allows to define a combination of one direct call to a Convertigo transaction or sequence and/or one launch of Mashup Composer event. \
Filling this property adds a {{Computer}}mashup_event{{-Computer}} attribute to the block, containing the previous combination in a JSON syntax of one of the following formats: \
***{{Computer}}{"requestable":{"__transaction":"<transaction name>","__connector":"<connector name>"}}{{-Computer}} for a transaction call only, \
***{{Computer}}{"requestable":{"__sequence":"<sequence name>"}}{{-Computer}} for a sequence call only, \
***{{Computer}}{"event":"<event name>"}{{Computer}} for a mashup event only, \
***{{Computer}}{"requestable":{"__transaction":"<transaction name>","__connector":"<connector name>"},"event":"<event name>"}{{-Computer}} for a transaction call and a mashup event, \
***{{Computer}}{"requestable":{"__sequence":"<sequence name>"},"event":"<event name>"}{{-Computer}} for a sequence call and a mashup event.\n \
This {{Computer}}mashup_event{{-Computer}} attribute and its content have to be handled by the XSL file applying at the end of the transaction to generate a real Convertigo call and/or Mashup Composer event on click on the displayed object.
