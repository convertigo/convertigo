display_name=Client instruction click
short_description=Automatically clicks on a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | The {{Reference}}Client instruction click{{-Reference}} extraction rule stores an instruction of clicking on an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of clicking on an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser. \n\
The target element is defined thanks to the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. This property is a JavaScript expression, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied. \n\
In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules. \n\
Consuming the {{Reference}}Client instruction click{{-Reference}} instruction, the engine selects the target element using the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} and clicks on it. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} The click is perfomed using the JQuery {{Computer}}click{{-Computer}} function. For more information about this function, see the following page: {{Computer}}http://api.jquery.com/click/{{-Computer}}.
