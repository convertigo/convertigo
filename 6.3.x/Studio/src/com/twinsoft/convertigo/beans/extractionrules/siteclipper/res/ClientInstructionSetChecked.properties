display_name=Client instruction set checked
short_description=Automatically checks a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | The {{Reference}}Client instruction set checked{{-Reference}} extraction rule stores an instruction of checking/unchecking an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of checking/unchecking an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser. \n\
The target element (checkbox or radio button) is defined thanks to the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} property and the state to which change the element is defined by the {{Produit/Fonction}}Checked state{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. These properties are JavaScript expressions, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied. \n\
In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules. \n\
Consuming the {{Reference}}Client instruction set checked{{-Reference}} instruction, the engine selects the target element using the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} and depending on the {{Produit/Fonction}}Checked state{{-Produit/Fonction}} property value: \
***sets the attribute {{Computer}}checked="checked"{{-Computer}} on the target element, if the {{Produit/Fonction}}Checked state{{-Produit/Fonction}} evaluation is {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}, \
***removes the {{Computer}}checked{{-Computer}} attribute from the target element otherwise.
property.targetvalue.display_name=Checked state
property.targetvalue.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the boolean value used to change the target element state. | This property defines the checked state to set on the target element. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a boolean to be used as follows: \
***{{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} for checked state, \
***{{Computer}}false{{-Computer}} for unchecked state. \n\
The target element should be an {{Computer}}INPUT{{-Computer}} element of {{Computer}}checkbox{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}radio{{-Computer}} type.
