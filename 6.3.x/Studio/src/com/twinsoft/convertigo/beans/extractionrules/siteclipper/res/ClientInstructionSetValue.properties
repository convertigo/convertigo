display_name=Client instruction set value
short_description=Automatically sets a value in a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | The {{Reference}}Client instruction set value{{-Reference}} extraction rule stores an instruction of setting a value in an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of setting a value in a target element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser. \n\
The target element (input field or text area) is defined thanks to the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} property and the value to enter in the field is defined by the {{Produit/Fonction}}Value{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. These properties are JavaScript expressions, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied. \n\
In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the {{Computer}}client instruction engine{{-Computer}} runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules. \n\
Consuming the {{Reference}}Client instruction set value{{-Reference}} instruction, the engine selects the target element using the {{Produit/Fonction}}JQuery selector{{-Produit/Fonction}} and sets the {{Computer}}value{{-Computer}} attribute with the value computed by the rule using the {{Produit/Fonction}}Value{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} The value is set using the JQuery {{Computer}}val{{-Computer}} function. For more information about this function, see the following page: {{Computer}}http://api.jquery.com/val/{{-Computer}}.
property.targetvalue.display_name=Value
property.targetvalue.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the string value to set in the target element. | This property defines the value to be entered in the target element. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a string to be used as a text value. \n\
The target element should be: \
***an {{Computer}}INPUT{{-Computer}} element of {{Computer}}text{{-Computer}}, {{Computer}}hidden{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}password{{-Computer}} type, \
***a {{Computer}}SELECT{{-Computer}} element, \
***a {{Computer}}TEXTAREA{{-Computer}} element.
