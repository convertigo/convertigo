display_name=Rewrite location header
short_description=Rewrites the "{{Computer}}Content-Location{{-Computer}}" header value of a Site Clipper response. | The {{Reference}}Rewrite location header{{-Reference}} extraction rule rewrites the "{{Computer}}Content-Location{{-Computer}}" header value of a Site Clipper response. \n\
This response header is mostly used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the requested one for completion of the request or identification of a new resource. The extraction rule rewrites this URL in order to access the new location through Convertigo Site Clipper. \n\
The {{Reference}}Rewrite location header{{-Reference}} extraction rule's behavior depends on the type of URL found in the header. If the URI specified by the location's value is absolute, two cases are possible:\
*** if the URI doesn't match a black listed domain defined in {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}}, the header value is automatically rewritten, \
*** else, the header value remains unchanged. \n\
If the URI specified by the location's value is relative, it is automatically rewritten. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} If applicable, location's URI is rewritten to an absolute value so that next client's request for the given resource is correctly handled by Convertigo.
