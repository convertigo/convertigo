display_name=Generic Sequence
short_description=Defines and orchestrates a series of actions. | A {{Reference}}Sequence{{-Reference}} defines actions (called {{Reference}}Steps{{-Reference}}), the order in which they are executed and conditions of execution. It follows a logical process meant at achieving a specific goal.\n\
A {{Reference}}Sequence{{-Reference}} can be set as part of the project containing transactions to be orchestrated or as part of any other project. For example, a sequencer project can contain {{Reference}}Sequences{{-Reference}} orchestrating exclusively transactions from other projects. \n\
Any {{Reference}}Sequence{{-Reference}} can be triggered as a Web Service in SOAP or REST protocol. It can return XML data combined from the orchestrated transactions and other steps to the Web Service caller. Any XML output structure can be defined using appropriate steps. \n\
"Blind" {{Reference}}Sequences{{-Reference}} are also possible - they do not return any data to the caller, but can for example insert data in databases using a defined {{Reference}}SQL connector{{-Reference}}, or insert data into forms (thanks to {{Reference}}Web Integration transactions{{-Reference}} for example).
property.sheetLocation.display_name=Style sheet
property.sheetLocation.short_description=Defines how the XML returned by the sequence has to be processed by XSLT. | This property can take the following values:\
***{{Computer}}None{{-Computer}}: Do not process with XSLT. Usual setting for Web services (SOAP or REST) where plain XML data is to be returned.\
***{{Computer}}From sequence{{-Computer}}: Use the XSL style sheet attached to the sequence. When used, make sure a style sheet is added to the sequence.
