short_description=Redirects to a {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}}. | {{Reference}}Continue with Site Clipper{{-Reference}} statement ends an {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} by redirecting the context to a {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}}. It is set at the end of an handler to end the {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}}, which results in that no other handler nor statement from the transaction is executed after it. \n\
This statement specifies a redirection URL to its parent connector in the transaction's XML output. This rewritten URL is an absolute URL pointing to the current Convertigo project, with a particular syntax:\
***it starts with the usual project's path, \
***it then specifies the Convertigo context and the {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} to use, \
***it ends with the {{Computer}}.siteclipper{{-Computer}} extension, \
***after the extension, the target resource URL is concatenated, replacing the '{{Computer}}://{{-Computer}}' symbols after the target resource protocol, ({{Computer}}http://{{-Computer}} for example, by a '{{Computer}}/{{-Computer}}' character. \n\
This gives the following URL form: \n\
{{Computer}}http://<convertigo_server_host>:<convertigo_server_port>/convertigo/projects/<project_name>/context=<context_name>&connector=<connector_name>.siteclipper/<target_resource_protocol>/<target_resource_host>/<target_resource_URI>{{-Computer}} \n\
The {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} accessed thanks to this URL then relays all HTTP messages between the client and the target server. For more information about Site Clipper, see {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} and related objects documentation. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} The {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} to which redirect is in the same project. Thus, the {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} and the {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} can share the same context.

property.siteClipperConnectorName.short_description=Define the {{Reference}}Site Clipper connector{{-Reference}} to which redirect. | The target connector can be chosen among the connectors from the same project as the {{Reference}}Continue with Site Clipper{{-Reference}} statement. Indeed, the HTML transaction including the {{Reference}}Continue with Site Clipper{{-Reference}} statement and the {{Reference}}Site Clipper{{-Reference}} connector must share the same context.
