short_description=Defines a function that can be invoked. | A {{Reference}}Function{{-Reference}} statement declares a new function for a transaction. It contains other statements defining actions to be performed by the function. It can only be added under a transaction.\n\
The {{Reference}}Functions{{-Reference}} defined for a transaction can then be called from one or several handlers using {{Reference}}Call Function{{-Reference}} statements (to perform the same actions on several screen classes for example).
