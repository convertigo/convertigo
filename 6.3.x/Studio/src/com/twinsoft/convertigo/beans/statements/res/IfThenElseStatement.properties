display_name=IfThenElse
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF...THEN...ELSE...{{-Computer}} conditional statement based on a JavaScript condition. | The {{Reference}}IfThenElse{{-Reference}} statement is one of the {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} conditional statements. It contains two child steps ({{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} and {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}}) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment: \
***{{Computer}}Then{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, \
***{{Computer}}Else{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.\n\
The condition, defined in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Condition{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}}. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} In Convertigo Studio, when an {{Reference}}IfThenElse{{-Reference}} statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an {{Reference}}If{{-Reference}}, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option {{Produit/Fonction}}Change to{{-Produit/Fonction}} > {{Produit/Fonction}}If{{-Produit/Fonction}}. The {{Produit/Fonction}}Condition{{-Produit/Fonction}} property remains the same and the statements present in the sub-statements are:\
***statements present in the {{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} statement are moved to the {{Reference}}If{{-Reference}}, \
***statements present in the {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}} statement are deleted.
