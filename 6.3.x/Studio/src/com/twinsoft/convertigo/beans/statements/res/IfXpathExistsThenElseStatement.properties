display_name=IfXpathExistsThenElse
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF...THEN...ELSE...{{-Computer}} conditional statement looking for node(s) on a web page. | The {{Reference}}IfXpathExistsThenElse{{-Reference}} statement is one of the {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} conditional statements. It contains two child steps ({{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} and {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}}) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment: \
***{{Computer}}Then{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, \
***{{Computer}}Else{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.\n\
The condition is the existence in the current web page of nodes matching the XPath defined through the {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} In Convertigo Studio, when an {{Reference}}IfXpathExistsThenElse{{-Reference}} statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an {{Reference}}IfXpathExists{{-Reference}}, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option {{Produit/Fonction}}Change to{{-Produit/Fonction}} > {{Produit/Fonction}}IfXpathExists{{-Produit/Fonction}}. The {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property remains the same and the statements present in the sub-statements are:\
***statements present in the {{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} statement are moved to the {{Reference}}IfXpathExists{{-Reference}}, \
***statements present in the {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}} statement are deleted.
property.condition.display_name=XPath
property.condition.short_description=Defines the XPath expression to test. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as an XPath. \n\
The execution of this {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} on the web page DOM is used as a condition in order to decide whether to execute or not the child statements: \
***{{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} if one or several nodes are matching the XPath, \
***{{Computer}}false{{-Computer}} if no node matches.
