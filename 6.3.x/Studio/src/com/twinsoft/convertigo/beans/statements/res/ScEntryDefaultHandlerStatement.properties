display_name=Default entry handler
short_description=Defines a transaction default entry handler. | A {{Reference}}handler{{-Reference}} is similar to a {{Computer}}Function{{-Computer}} except that it is automatically executed when the associated event occurs. The {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} is an entry screen class handler, associated with an entry on a screen class event. If present in a transaction, it is executed when no specific screen class entry handler is defined for the currently detected screen class. In other words, it is a generic entry screen class handler.\n\
Thus, {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} can be defined for multiple screen classes on which the programmer knows that the same actions are to be done.\n\
Beware that this handler will be executed for the {{Computer}}Default_screen_class{{-Computer}} screen class if no specific handler is defined for this screen class. As the {{Computer}}Default_screen_class{{-Computer}} screen class matches every page that is not defined in the connector, this handler can potentially be executed on a lot of unmanaged pages. Such behaviors can lead to infinite loop transactions.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} \
***A {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} contains other statements that define the actions to be performed. It can return a result value ({{Computer}}redetect{{-Computer}} by default as it is an entry handler).\
***{{Reference}}Default entry handlers{{-Reference}} can only be added to a transaction, one {{Reference}}Default entry handler{{-Reference}} per transaction.
