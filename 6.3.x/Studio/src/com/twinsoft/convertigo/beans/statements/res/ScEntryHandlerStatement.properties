It is executed when Convertigo detects the screen class corresponding to this {{Reference}}Screen class entry handler{{-Reference}}, before executing the extraction rules associated with this screen class.\n\
In other words, a {{Reference}}Screen class entry handler{{-Reference}} is executed when arriving on the screen class associated with this handler.\n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Notes:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} \
***A {{Reference}}Screen class entry handler{{-Reference}} contains other statements that define the actions to be performed on this screen class. It can return a result value ({{Computer}}redetect{{-Computer}} by default as it is an entry handler).\
***{{Reference}}Screen class entry handlers{{-Reference}} can only be added to a transaction, one {{Reference}}Screen class entry handler{{-Reference}} for each screen class per transaction.
