display_name=Xpathable statement
short_description=Defines a statement with an XPath property.
property.xpath.display_name=XPath
property.xpath.short_description=Defines the XPath expression of elements on which the statement applies. | Depending on the statement, the execution of this {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} on the web page DOM can result in a single {{Computer}}Node{{-Computer}} or a {{Computer}}NodeList{{-Computer}}.
property.delay.display_name=Delay if XPath not found
property.delay.short_description=Defines the maximum delay the statement waits if the XPath doesn't currently exists. | When no node in the page DOM matches the XPath defined in {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, the statement waits for it to match up to this delay, set in milliseconds. \n\
Convertigo tries to evaluate the specified XPath while receiving a Web page or executing JavaScript in it. Once the XPath matches at least one node of the page, the statement continues its action. \n\
Note: It is equivalent to defining a statement {{Reference}}Wait synchronization{{-Reference}} with an {{Computer}}XPath{{-Computer}} synchronizer before this statement, waiting for the same XPath.
