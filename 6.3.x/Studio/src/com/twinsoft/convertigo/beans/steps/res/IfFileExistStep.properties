display_name=IfFileExists
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF{{-Computer}} conditional step looking for the existence of a file or a directory. | The {{Reference}}IfFileExists{{-Reference}} step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step contains other steps executed only if the file or directory defined through the {{Produit/Fonction}}Source{{-Produit/Fonction}} property exists. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} In Convertigo Studio, when an {{Reference}}IfFileExists{{-Reference}} step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an {{Reference}}IfFileExistsThenElse{{-Reference}}, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option {{Produit/Fonction}}Change to{{-Produit/Fonction}} > {{Produit/Fonction}}IfFileExistsThenElse{{-Produit/Fonction}}. The {{Produit/Fonction}}Source{{-Produit/Fonction}} property remains the same and the steps present in the {{Reference}}IfFileExists{{-Reference}} are moved to the {{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} sub-step.

***{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}} are relative to Convertigo home,\
***{{Computer}}.//{{-Computer}} are relative to the project folder.
