display_name=jIfThenElse
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF...THEN...ELSE...{{-Computer}} conditional step based on a JavaScript condition. | The {{Reference}}jIfThenElse{{-Reference}} step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains two child steps ({{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} and {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}}) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment:\
***{{Computer}}Then{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, \
***{{Computer}}Else{{-Computer}} step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.\n\
The condition, defined in the {{Produit/Fonction}}Condition{{-Produit/Fonction}} property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} or {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}}. \n\
{{Orange Twinsoft}}Note:{{-Orange Twinsoft}} In Convertigo Studio, when an {{Reference}}jIfThenElse{{-Reference}} step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an {{Reference}}jIf{{-Reference}}, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option {{Produit/Fonction}}Change to{{-Produit/Fonction}} > {{Produit/Fonction}}jIf{{-Produit/Fonction}}. The {{Produit/Fonction}}Condition{{-Produit/Fonction}} property remains the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:\
***steps present in the {{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} step are moved to the {{Reference}}jIf{{-Reference}}, \
***steps present in the {{Reference}}Else{{-Reference}} step are deleted.
