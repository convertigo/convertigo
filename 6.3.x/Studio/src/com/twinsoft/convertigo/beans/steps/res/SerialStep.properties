short_description=Defines a step executing child steps in series. | All child steps of a {{Reference}}Serial{{-Reference}} step are executed one after another, it is similar to the basic behavior of step execution when they are positioned just under the parent {{Reference}}Generic Sequence{{-Reference}}.\n\
A {{Reference}}Serial{{-Reference}} step is completed (i.e. the sequence will continue flow execution) when all child steps have been completed. This means the step following a {{Reference}}Serial{{-Reference}} step starts right after the last child step is completed.
