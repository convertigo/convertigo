display_name=Javelin transaction
short_description=Defines an emulator-based transaction. | As regards legacy applications, Convertigo's basic principle is to:\
***navigate through legacy screens,\
***detect defined screen classes,\
***extract legacy screen data in accordance with screen class-specific extraction rules,\
***treat extracted data in order to generate an XML document structured as required.\n\
This process defines the notion of transaction. A transaction can be defined as a series of steps called statements. Statements are signaled by events. In other words, a transaction is made up of a set of event handlers, also called screen class handlers.\n\
Screen transactions are written by the Convertigo programmer in plain JavaScript language. The programmer can therefore leverage the full power of the language while manipulating specific Convertigo objects, like {{Computer}}javelin{{-Computer}} for accessing legacy screen funtionnality, {{Computer}}context{{-Computer}} for accessing Convertigo useful information, {{Computer}}dom{{-Computer}} for extended use and XML generation customization.
property.timeoutForConnect.short_description=Defines the timeout for connecting to the host (in seconds).
property.timeoutForConnect.display_name=Connection timeout
property.timeoutForDataStable.short_description=Defines the timeout for detecting stable screen (in seconds).
property.timeoutForDataStable.display_name=Data stable timeout
property.dataStableThreshold.display_name=Datastable threshold
property.dataStableThreshold.short_description=Defines the inactivity time (in ms) before considering a screen fully built. | The datastable threshold is therefore lower than the stable screen waiting time (Videotex emulator: duration of net inactivity; SNA emulator: inactivity timeout for OIA indicator).
property.onlyOnePage.display_name=Only one page
property.onlyOnePage.short_description=Defines whether data should be accumulated in one single page.
property.executeExtractionRulesInPanels.display_name=Execute extraction rules in panels
property.executeExtractionRulesInPanels.short_description=Defines whether extraction rules should be executed in panels.
property.removeBlocksNode.display_name=Remove 'blocks' nodes
property.removeBlocksNode.short_description=Defines whether encompassing "blocks" node should be removed (useful in web services context).
