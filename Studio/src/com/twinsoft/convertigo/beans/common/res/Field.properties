display_name=Field/Text
short_description=Adds a field or text on the webized screen. | Unlike other extraction rules, the <i>Field/Text</i> extraction rule does not extract data from green screen, but adds text elements on screen.<br/>\
This rule adds <span class="computer">field</span> or <span class="computer">static</span> type XML element to the XML document. These elements are then processed by XSL transformation to display a field or text label in the HTML page.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 XML elements of the <span class="computer">field</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">field</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">field.xsl</span> file. To change the way fields are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.<br/>\
 \u2022 XML elements of the <span class="computer">static</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">static</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">static.xsl</span> file. To change the way texts are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.<br/>
property.value.display_name=Value
property.value.short_description=Defines the field or text value, depending on the element type. | If the added element is of:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">field</span> type: the created field is filled with the value.<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">static</span> type: the value is added as static text on screen.<br/>
property.type.display_name=Field type
property.type.short_description=Defines the field/text type. | The element can be either of <span class="computer">field</span> or of <span class="computer">static</span> type.
property.name.display_name=Field name
property.name.short_description=Defines the field name. | When data is submitted by the user through this field, it is sent to Convertigo as a variable named after this property. It can then be used in a transaction. Use the <span class="computer">__field_c<column>_l<line></span> syntax to have Convertigo add data on screen at defined line and column.
property.fielddesc.display_name=Field layout
property.fielddesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the field/text is to be displayed. | This property allows to position the created text or field element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes. <br/>\
The screen area is defined through four coordinates: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 x (area left corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 y (area upper corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 w (area width), <br/>\
 \u2022 h (area height). <br/>\
<br/>\
All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <span class="computer">-1</span> represents an undefined value. <br/>\
These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the element.
property.focus.display_name=Focus on field
property.focus.short_description=Specifies whether the focus must be placed on this field.
property.fieldattrb.display_name=Field attributes
property.fieldattrb.short_description=Defines the generated field/text presentation attributes. | This property allows to configure the presentation attributes to set to the created text/field, for example green text on black background.<br/>\
Presentation attributes to configure are :\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Color</b>: <span class="computer">Foreground</span> color, <span class="computer">Background</span> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Decoration</b>: <span class="computer">bold</span>, <span class="computer">reverse</span>, <span class="computer">underlined</span>, <span class="computer">blink</span>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".<br/>
