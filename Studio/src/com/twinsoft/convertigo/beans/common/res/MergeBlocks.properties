display_name=Merge blocks
short_description=Merges multiple blocks into one or several bigger blocks. | The <i>Merge blocks</i> extraction rule:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 looks for series of blocks matching the following pattern: <span class="computer">[any block #1] [separator string block] [any block #2]</span><br/>\
 \u2022 merges their content in the first block : <span class="computer">['block #1 content' 'separator string' 'block #2 content']</span><br/>\
<br/>\
Separator strings are optional. If not specified, the content of blocks is merged whatsoever, provided that they match rule selection parameters (<b>Screen zone</b>, <b>Presentation attributes</b>).<br/>\
By default, the <i>Merge blocks</i> extraction rule works on separate lines, meaning that two blocks must be on the same line to be merged. However, the rule can be set so that blocks are merged even if they belong to separate lines. In this case, a line break string can be set. <br/>\
When two blocks from different lines are merged, this line break string is inserted in their content: <span class="computer">[block nb 1] [separator string block] [block nb 2]</span><br/>\
Once merged, the resulting block is as follows:<span class="computer">['block nb 1 content' 'separator string' 'line break string' 'block nb 2 content']</span>.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 This rule does not add any specific XML attribute. However, the resulting block inherits the attributes (column, line, colors...) from the first merged block of the row. <br/>\
 \u2022 Since this rule does not create a new block type, it does not involve any specific XSL stylesheet.<br/>
property.separationPattern.display_name=Separator
property.separationPattern.short_description=Defines a separator string, case independent (optional). | Merges only blocks separated by a third block, the content of which is equal to the value of the separator string.<br/>\
If this property is not filled, the rule merges matching blocks that are not separated by any blocks. 
property.bMultiline.display_name=Multiline
property.bMultiline.short_description=Defines whether the merge should be multiline. | Enables to merge blocks located on different lines. If set to <span class="computer">false</span>, one block will result on each line; if set to <span class="computer">true</span>, one block will result from all blocks from every lines.
property.multilineSeparatorChar.display_name=Line separator
property.multilineSeparatorChar.short_description=Defines the character to add to distinct lines. | If <b>Multiline</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, and if two blocks belonging to separate lines are merged, then the string value of this property is inserted in-between.
