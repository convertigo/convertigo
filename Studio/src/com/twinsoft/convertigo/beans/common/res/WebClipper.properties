display_name=Web Clipper
short_description=Clips fragments of a web page. | The <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule extracts entire parts of an HTML page. It is applied if the result of the Xpath expression evaluation exists into the HTML page DOM. <br/>\
The fragment resulting from the Xpath expression evaluation on the HTML page DOM is appended to the HTML transaction output document, with its presentation (images, style sheets, etc.) and behavior (scripts, links, etc.). The URI paths present in the elements of this fragment are changed by Convertigo in order not to point directly towards these URIs.
property.attributes.display_name=Attributes
property.attributes.short_description=Lists the names of attributes that have to be processed by the rewriting of URI paths.<br/>\

<li><span class="computer">cache</span>: the resources are got through COnvertigo HTTP tunnel and the tunnel uses cache,</li>\
<li><span class="computer">no cache</span>: the resources are got through COnvertigo HTTP tunnel and the tunnel doesn't use cache.</li></ul>
