display_name=Table
short_description=Extracts data from a web page in an XML table. | The {{Reference}}Table{{-Reference}} extraction rule helps you extract data into a table structure. \n\
Extracted data are organized into an XML table structure made of:\
*** a parent base element "corresponding to" the base HTML element containing data to extract. In most cases, this element is an HTML {{Computer}}table{{-Computer}} element.\
*** child elements "corresponding to" recurring row HTML part. In most cases, if root is an HTML {{Computer}}table{{-Computer}} element, each {{Computer}}tr{{-Computer}} element is assumed to be a row of data.\
*** rows child elements "corresponding to" recurring column HTML part. In most cases, within a {{Computer}}tr{{-Computer}} row, each {{Computer}}td{{-Computer}} element is assumed to be a cell.\n\
The rule is applied if the result of the table XPath expression evaluation exists in the HTML page DOM.\n\
Based on this root, the child elements are also defined by Xpath expressions. Each Xpath expression may be relative to its parent element Xpath expression, using the following syntax: "{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}}".\n\
By default, a row XPath expression is {{Computer}}.//TR{{-Computer}}. You can add restrictions in the XPath expression, for example {{Computer}}.//TR[position() > 1]{{-Computer}}, meaning that each {{Computer}}tr{{-Computer}} element within the {{Computer}}table{{-Computer}} is a row except the first one. \n\
Columns are defined relatively to their parent row. By default, a column Xpath expression is {{Computer}}.//TD{{-Computer}}.\n\
The resulting table element is appended to the HTML transaction DOM as follows:\n\
{{Computer}}<table_tagname referer="referer_url">{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}  <row_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}   <column1_tagname>extracted text from xpath</column1_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}   <column2_tagname>extracted text from xpath</column2_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}  </row_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}  <row_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}   <column1_tagname>extracted text from xpath</column1_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}   <column2_tagname>extracted text from xpath</column2_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}  </row_tagname>{{-Computer}}\n\
{{Computer}}</table_tagname>{{-Computer}}
property.tagName.display_name=Tag name
property.tagName.short_description=Defines the table tag name in the resulting XML (default tag name is {{Computer}}XMLTable{{-Computer}}). 
property.description.display_name=Description
property.description.short_description=Describes the table structure in which data are extracted. | The table is structured as a root element containing row and column child elements, which are defined through {{Produit/Fonction}}Description{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
This property is a list of child elements descriptions, also named rows descriptions. Each row is described using two properties:\
***Row tag name: Row element tag name in resulting DOM (the default tag name is {{Computer}}row{{-Computer}}). All resulting nodes described by the following row XPath are tagged after this name.\
***Row XPath: XPath expression selecting row elements . It is often  defined relatively to parent {{Reference}}Table{{-Reference}} extraction rule XPath expression. The XPath can result in several nodes (ex {{Computer}}.//TR{{-Computer}}) meaning that several rows are being extracted.\
Each row description contains a list of child elements descriptions, also named columns descriptions. Each column description is composed of the following fields:\
***Column tag name: Columns element tag name in resulting DOM (the default name is {{Computer}}column{{-Computer}}).\
***Column XPath: XPath expression selecting column elements (data to extract). It is often defined relatively to parent row Xpath expression using the following syntax: "{{Computer}}./{{-Computer}}".\
***Extract children: Indicates whether text extraction should recurse on child elements of the elements found thanks to the Xpath (by default it is set to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}}). As it needs more CPU if set to "true", it is then recommended to customize your XPath (using {{Computer}}//text(){{-Computer}} function for example) and set this property to {{Computer}}false{{-Computer}}.
property.accumulateDataInSameTable.display_name=Accumulate data in same table
property.accumulateDataInSameTable.short_description=Accumulates every data from several screens in the same table XML element.
property.fliptable.display_name=Flip table orientation
property.fliptable.short_description=Flips the table orientation, turning lines into columns and columns into lines.
