display_name=CICS connector
short_description=Establishes connections with a CICS application. | A CICS Transaction Gateway can host several servers running different applications. In a CICS application, the display and business logics are usually managed in distinct programs. <br/>\
Programs exchange input and output data through a memory pool called COMMAREA (COMMON AREA). The COMMAREA is usually mapped by a definition of COBOL data included in communicating programs. This definition can be stored in two ways:\
<ul><li> built in the source code of the CICS program,</li>\
<li> stored in a separate file, called <span class="computer">copybook</span>, that is copied when compiling.</li></ul><br/>\
From a Convertigo point of view, a <i>CICS connector</i> represents a gateway server.
