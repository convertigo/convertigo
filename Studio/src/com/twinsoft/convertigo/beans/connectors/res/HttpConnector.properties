The {{Reference}}HTTP connector{{-Reference}} is used to consume web services such as REST, SOAP or JSON, as well as getting data using HTTP protocol.\n\
To call a REST or SOAP web service, {{Reference}}XML HTTP Transactions{{-Reference}} have to be used as these web services are XML-based. To consume a JSON web service, {{Reference}}JSON HTTP Transactions{{-Reference}} have to be used as it performs the conversion from the JSON data to the transaction output XML. To retrieve any other data in HTTP protocol (non XML-based REST web service, image or file getting, etc.), standard {{Reference}}HTTP Transaction{{-Reference}} has to be used as its response is text-based.

property.trustAllServerCertificates.display_name=Trust all certificates
property.trustAllServerCertificates.short_description=Defines whether trusted certificates must be checked. | In SSL mode, the server sends existing certificates to Convertigo. In most cases, set this setting to {{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} to automatically trust all server certificates. If set to {{Computer}}false {{-Computer}}, target server certificates must be installed in Convertigo.

property.httpHeaderForward.display_name=HTTP headers forwarding policy
property.httpHeaderForward.short_description=Defines the HTTP headers to forward and the policy to use to forward them. | This property allows forwarding HTTP headers from the client browser to the target application. \n\
This property allows to define a list of HTTP headers to forward and, for each header, the forwarding policy to use. For each header, two columns have to be set: \
***{{Produit/Fonction}}Header name{{-Produit/Fonction}}: defines the name of the header to forward, \
***{{Produit/Fonction}}Forwarding policy{{-Produit/Fonction}}: defines how to replace the header value when forwarding it. \n\
This second property can take the following values: \
***{{Computer}}Merge{{-Computer}}: If the forwarded header exists, its value is merged with existing one. If the forwarded header doesn't exist, it is added.\
***{{Computer}}Ignore{{-Computer}}: If the forwarded header exists, its value is not replaced, it is ignored. If the forwarded header doesn't exist, it is added.\
