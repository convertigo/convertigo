display_name=Project
short_description=Defines a Convertigo project. | The <i>Project</i> is the basic entity of a Convertigo project. It contains all Convertigo objects needed for a Convertigo project to run properly:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 connectors,<br/>\
 \u2022 screen classes (with criteria, extraction rules and style sheets),<br/>\
 \u2022 transactions (with handlers, statements, style sheets, variables and test cases),<br/>\
 \u2022 pools, <br/>\
 \u2022 sequences  (with steps, style sheets, variables and test cases).<br/>
property.httpSessionTimeout.display_name=HTTP session timeout
property.httpSessionTimeout.short_description=Defines the inactivity time (in seconds) of incoming HTTP sessions. | If no requests are sent from the same user on the project for the set lifetime, Convertigo automatically removes any context existing for this user and frees memory. <br/>\
When the context is freed, the <b>End Transaction</b> defined for the connector is automatically executed. You can set in this transaction any clean up code as a <span class="computer">logout</span> transaction to logout from the target application.
property.browserDefinitions.display_name=Browsers
property.browserDefinitions.short_description=Defines available browser types. | This property is a table describing browser clients able to connect to Convertigo. It is used by Convertigo to choose the proper XSL style sheet for rendering HTML pages (for example for Mobile devices).<br/>\
For each browser signature, the <b>Browsers definition</b> table contains two columns:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Keyword</b>: Each keyword is evaluated in turn by Convertigo. If any keyword set here is found in the browser signature by Convertigo, it is considered used by the client.<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Label</b>: Name of the browser used by the client. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> A new browser definition can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The browser definitions defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon.
property.wsdlStyle.display_name=WSDL style
property.wsdlStyle.short_description=Defines the project's WSDL style to use for the project (<span class="computer">DOC/LITERAL</span>, <span class="computer">RPC</span>, <span class="computer">ALL</span>).
property.schemaInline.display_name=WSDL inline schemas
property.schemaInline.short_description=Specifies whether the project's WSDL should be generated by including schemas or not. | The WSDL describing the services can import the schemas defined in a separate file or can describe inline these schemas. <br/>\
This property allows to specify the way the Convertigo developer wants schemas for the project's WSDL. 
property.namespaceUri.display_name=Namespace URI
property.namespaceUri.short_description=Defines the project's namespace URI to use in XSD and WSDL files. | If this property is left empty, the default Convertigo project's namespace URI is used: <span class="computer">http://www.convertigo.com/convertigo/projects/<project_name></span> with <span class="computer"><project_name></span> the name of the current project.
property.schemaElementForm.display_name=Schema default element forms
property.schemaElementForm.short_description=Defines the default element forms to use for the project's schema (<span class="computer">qualified</span>, <span class="computer">unqualified</span>). | In some frameworks, XML elements from transaction or sequence response have to be qualified, i.e. the XML tag name should include the namespace. By default set to <span class="computer">qualified</span>, this property allows the developer to force the XML output to use unqualified element forms by setting its value to <span class="computer">unqualified</span>. 
property.version.display_name=Version
property.version.short_description=Defines the project's version. | This property is an editable field that allows the project's developer to set a project's version. The project version syntax is free, the developer can use it the way he wants. <br/>\
When exporting the project as an archive (<span class="computer">.car</span>) or deploying the project (on a server for example), the Convertigo Studio user interface proposes to the developer to update this project's version number field. It helps the developer to not forget editing it before a project's delivery.
property.exported.display_name=Exported date
property.exported.short_description=Specifies the last date the project was exported. | This property is a read-only field containing a timestamp that is automatically set when saving, exporting or deploying the project. <br/>\
It displays the date and time of the last save of the project. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> When clicking on this property in the <b>Properties</b> view, you can see the exact timestamp value.
property.bStrictMode.display_name=Strict mode
property.bStrictMode.short_description=Specifies whether the project uses strict mode for <b>source</b> XPath. | Strict mode is the default mode for 7.3 projects.<br/>\
<br/>\
In <b>strict mode</b> , when a sequence calls a transaction or an other sequence, a sourced element is sent itself as a root object instead of sending the child elments.\
This behavior changes the way you should source elements containing text nodes. In <b>strict mode</b> , if you want to send the string value of an element you must point the \
source picker on the <b>text</b> node of this element and not on the element itself. This will result by generating an <b>/element/text()</b> xpath expression for the source. \
<br/><br/>\
Strict mode is very useful to send complex data to structured back ends such as the FullSync connector. Previous version projects will be automatically migrated as <b>Strict Mode</b> to <b>false</b> making sure that your projects will run safely in 7.3 without having to \
change your sources.    
property.jsonOutput.display_name=JSON requester output
property.jsonOutput.short_description=Specifies how the .json and .jsonp requesters convert XML to JSON. | This property can take the following values: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>verbose</b>: The JSON describes the XML: "attr", "text", "value" with sub objects.<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>use type attributes</b>: The JSON interpret "type" XML attribute to convert the content into the right JSON type. Compatible with the JSON HTTP transaction output.<br/>
