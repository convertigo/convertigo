display_name=Screen class
short_description=Defines a group of screens with common features. | By the term "screen" is meant a set of identifiable data which may be rendered to the user or not. It is generally used regardless of the resource accessed by Convertigo. <br/>\
Thus, depending on project's type, a screen may be defined by:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the data sent back by a Legacy host, for a green screen display, <br/>\
 \u2022 the data displayed by an HTML browser, for a web page display, <br/>\
 \u2022 the data contained in an HTTP message, for a resource request. <br/>\
<br/>\
A <i>Screen class</i> is identified by a set of criteria which are dedicated to screen's data detection. When accessing a screen (web resource or legacy screen), Convertigo looks for detection criteria defined for screen classes. <br/>\
Convertigo considers that the accessed screen belongs to the <i>Screen class</i> which all criteria match and which have the greatest number of criteria matching. \
For screen classes that would have the same number of matching criteria, Convertigo considers that the screen belongs to the screen class that has the greatest depth. \
And if screen classes also have the same depth, Convertigo considers that the screen belongs to the first screen class in alphabetical order. <br/>\
Depending on the project and connector type, detection criteria are the following:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 for Legacy Integrator and Legacy Publisher (Legacy screens): <i>Empty screen</i>, <i>Emulator technology</i>, <i>Find string</i>, <i>Regular expression</i>;<br/>\
 \u2022 for Web Integrator and Web Clipper (web pages): <i>XPath</i>;<br/>\
 \u2022 for Site Clipper (web applications): <i>MIME type</i>, <i>Regular expression</i>, <i>Request header</i>, <i>Response header</i>, <i>URL</i>.<br/>\
<br/>\
A <i>Screen class</i> can also be associated with extraction rules executed on its detection by Convertigo. Extraction rules define which data are to be extracted or modified from a screen and turned into a proper XML document (for CLI, CLP, CWI, CWC) or into an HTTP request or response (for CSC). <br/>\
<i>Screen classes</i> are pivotal in the execution of transactions, since their detection triggers the execution of screen class handlers (including actions to be performed on detected screens) and extraction rules (extracting data to be turned into XML, modifying HTTP data). <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> A <i>Screen class</i> do not define one screen only, but all screens matching the specified criteria. It is up to the Convertigo programmer to set detection criteria.
