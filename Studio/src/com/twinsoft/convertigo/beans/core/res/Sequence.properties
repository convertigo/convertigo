property.orderedVariables.short_description=Ordered variables priorities. | All input variables used by a sequence. Each defined variable is automatically inserted to the scope of the sequence and visible to any jXXX type step such as jIf. Variables are defined using the following set of parameters:\
***Variable: Variable name.\
***Description: Variable description.\
***Default value: Variable default value if no input value is sent to the transaction.\
***WSDL: If true, includes this variable in the generated SOAP WSDL as an input variable for this method (transaction) of the webservice.\
***Multi: Multi valued variables can be input more than once per request. Also, they are inserted into the transaction as JavaScript arrays, instead of strings.\
***Personalizable: When adding this transaction as a widget in Convertigo Mashup Composer, personalizable variables are added to the widget as user preferences.\
***Cached key: When considering cache usage to serve a request, Convertigo only compares cached key variables between the new request and the cached one to determine whether cache should be used or not.
