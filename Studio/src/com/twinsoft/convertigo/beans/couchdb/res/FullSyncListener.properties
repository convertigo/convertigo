short_description=Defines a FullSync synchronization listener for updated documents (by view). | A <b>FullSync Update Listener View</b> is a listener which helps handling synchronization for a FullSync database.<br/>\
A FullSync listener will associate a view and a sequence in this way:<br/><br/>\
 \u2022  When a modified or created document on the mobile device is replicated on Convertigo Server the listener will call its view passing the docid<br/>\
 \u2022  The View is responsible for filtering the document, for example testing if this document belongs to a specific family or type<br/>\
 \u2022  The Listener's sequence will be called with every document returned by the view so that the sequence can update data in the backend applications.
