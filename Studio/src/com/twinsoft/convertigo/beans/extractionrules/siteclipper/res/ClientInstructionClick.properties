display_name=Client instruction click
short_description=Automatically clicks on a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | The <i>Client instruction click</i> extraction rule stores an instruction of clicking on an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of clicking on an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser. <br/>\
The target element is defined thanks to the <b>JQuery selector</b> property. This property is a JavaScript expression, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied. <br/>\
In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, <span class="computer">client instruction engine</span> code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the <span class="computer">client instruction engine</span> runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules. <br/>\
Consuming the <i>Client instruction click</i> instruction, the engine selects the target element using the <b>JQuery selector</b> and clicks on it. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The click is perfomed using the JQuery <span class="computer">click</span> function. For more information about this function, see the following page: <span class="computer">http://api.jquery.com/click/</span>.
