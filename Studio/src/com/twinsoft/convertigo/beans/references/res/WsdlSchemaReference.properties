display_name=WSDL reference
short_description=A reference to a WSDL file to use in the project. |
property.filepath.display_name=WSDL local path
property.filepath.short_description=Defines the Convertigo local path of the imported WSDL file. | If the WSDL file to import is a local file in the current project or in the current workspace, this <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used to define the local file path. <br/>\
This path is relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:\
<ul><li><span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,</li>\
<li><span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. </li></ul><br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Only one of both <b>WSDL local path</b> or <b>WSDL URL</b> properties can be used. If both are filled, only <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used.
property.urlpath.display_name=WSDL URL
property.urlpath.short_description=Defines the URL of the WSDL file to import. | If the WSDL file to import is outside of the current project (either a remote file or a file on the developer's computer but external to the project), this <b>WSDL URL</b> property is used to define the file's original URL. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<ul><li>If the file to import is located in the file system (local or network drives), use the "Browse" button of the wizard: it will automatically create the correct file URL depending on your operating system (<span class="computer">file://[host]/path</span> or <span class="computer">file:[//host]/path</span>). </li>\
<li>Once imported, the WSDL file will be copied locally in the current project's resources. This will then fill the <b>WSDL local path</b> property. If both are filled, only <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used.</li></ul>
