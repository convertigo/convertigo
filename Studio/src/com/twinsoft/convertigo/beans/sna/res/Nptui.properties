short_description=Automatic <span class="computer">5250</span> extended objects extraction. | This rule automatically detects <span class="computer">Extended TN5250 NPTUI</span> objects in mainframe legacy screens. <br/>\
Unlike standard extraction rules, the <i>5250 extended objects</i> rule doens't visually identify objects in displayed screen. In fact, extended objects are well-defined structures and their presence in a screen is embedded inside the <span class="computer">TN5250</span> stream. One instance of the rule is then enough to correctly detect all NPTUI objects in the screen class.<br/>\
There are various extended, or NPTUI, elements available in such an application. Usual NPTUI objects are the following:\
<ul><li><b>Radio buttons</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <span class="computer">choice</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">choice</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">choice.xsl</span> file. To change the way choices are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file. </li>\
<li><b>Checkboxes</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of the <span class="computer">checkbox</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">checkbox</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">checkbox.xsl</span> file. To change the way checkboxes are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
<li><b>Windows</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of the <span class="computer">panel</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">panel</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">panel.xsl</span> file. To change the way panels are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
<li><b>Continuous fields</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <span class="computer">filed</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">field</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">field.xsl</span> file. To change the way fields are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
<li><b>Buttons</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <span class="computer">keyword</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">keyword</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">keyword.xsl</span> file. To change the way keywords are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file. </li>\
<li><b>Sliders</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <span class="computer">slider</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">slider</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">slider.xsl</span> file.
