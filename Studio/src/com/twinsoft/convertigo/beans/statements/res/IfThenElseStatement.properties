display_name=IfThenElse
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF...THEN...ELSE...</span> conditional statement based on a JavaScript condition. | The <i>IfThenElse</i> statement is one of the <i>HTML transaction</i> conditional statements. It contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">Then</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">Else</span> step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.<br/>\
<br/>\
The condition, defined in the <b>Condition</b> property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as <span class="computer">true</span> or <span class="computer">false</span>. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfThenElse</i> statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an <i>If</i>, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>If</b>. The <b>Condition</b> property remains the same and the statements present in the sub-statements are:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 statements present in the <i>Then</i> statement are moved to the <i>If</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 statements present in the <i>Else</i> statement are deleted.<br/>
