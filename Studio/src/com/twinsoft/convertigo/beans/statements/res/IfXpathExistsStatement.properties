display_name=IfXpathExists
short_description=Defines an {{Computer}}IF{{-Computer}} conditional statement looking for node(s) on a web page. | The {{Reference}}IfXpathExists{{-Reference}} statement is one of the {{Reference}}HTML transaction{{-Reference}} conditional statements. It conditionally executes a block of statements, depending on the fulfillment of a condition expression. In other words, if the condition is fulfilled, child statements are executed. \n\
The condition is the existence in the current web page of nodes matching the XPath defined through the {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property. \n\
Note: In Convertigo Studio, when an {{Reference}}IfXpathExists{{-Reference}} statement is created in a handler, it can be easily replaced by an {{Reference}}IfXpathExistsThenElse{{-Reference}}, using the right-click menu on the statement and choosing the option {{Produit/Fonction}}Change to{{-Produit/Fonction}} > {{Produit/Fonction}}IfXpathExistsThenElse{{-Produit/Fonction}}. The {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} property remains the same and the statements present in the {{Reference}}IfXpathExists{{-Reference}} are moved to the {{Reference}}Then{{-Reference}} sub-statement.
property.condition.display_name=XPath
property.condition.short_description=Defines the XPath expression to test. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as an XPath. \n\
The execution of this {{Produit/Fonction}}XPath{{-Produit/Fonction}} on the web page DOM is used as a condition in order to decide whether to execute or not the child statements: \
***{{Computer}}true{{-Computer}} if one or several nodes are matching the XPath, \
***{{Computer}}false{{-Computer}} if no node matches.
