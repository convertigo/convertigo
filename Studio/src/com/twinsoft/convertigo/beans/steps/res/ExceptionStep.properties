display_name=jException
short_description=Raises a Convertigo Engine exception. | In some circumstances, it is necessary to explicitly raise a Convertigo Engine exception. This is reflected as a <span class="computer">SoapFaultException</span> for SOAP web service callers or by an error structure in XML output for any other caller. <br/>\
<b>Message</b> and <b>Details</b> properties can be set to complex JavaScript expressions, mixing text strings and data from variables. These expressions are evaluated during the sequence execution and build a dynamic message and details output in the raised exception. <br/>\
The error XML structure contains a <span class="computer">type</span> attribute, which value is automatically set to <span class="computer">c8o</span> in case of Exception. It allows to differentiate an irrecoverable Server error from a project/applicative error created using an <i>Error</i> step (<span class="computer">type</span> attribute value is then <span class="computer">project</span>). <br/>\
A <i>jException</i> step breaks the sequence execution flow, the sequence ends just after this step's execution (contrary to <i>Error</i> step which does not break the execution flow).
property.message.display_name=Message
property.message.short_description=Provides the (humanly readable) error message. | This property allows the developer to dynamically define the message text of the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution. 
property.details.display_name=Details
property.details.short_description=Provides additional details about the triggered error. | This property allows the developer to dynamically add some details content in the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.
