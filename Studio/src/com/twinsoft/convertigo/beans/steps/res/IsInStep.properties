display_name=IfIsIn
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF</span> conditional step looking for matches on a source. | The <i>IfIsIn</i> step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a source and one or more regular expression(s) called "Tests". Child steps are executed only if the specified source exists and if tests match on that specified source. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfIsIn</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfIsInThenElse</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> > <b>IfIsInThenElse</b>. The <b>Source</b> and <b>Tests</b> properties remain the same and the steps present in the <i>IfIsIn</i> are moved to the <i>Then</i> sub-step.
property.testDefinition.display_name=Tests
property.testDefinition.short_description=Defines match tests as regular expressions. | This property allows to define a list of tests that are applied on the source result. <br/>\
For each test, two elements have to be set:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Operator</b>: value to choose between <span class="computer">AND</span> and <span class="computer">NOT</span>, the operator value is applied on the regular expression result to keep it (<span class="computer">AND</span>) or to inverse it (<span class="computer">NOT</span>). <br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Regular exp</b>: defines a regular expression to apply (inverted or not thanks to operator value) on the source result. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 A new test can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The tests defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon. <br/>\
 \u2022 In order to be able to test the regular expressions on the source result, the defined source has to select a text node. <br/>\
 \u2022 For more information about regular expression patterns, see the following page: <span class="computer">http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html</span>. <br/>\
 \u2022 To test regular expressions, you can use the regular expression tester at the following URL: <span class="computer">http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html</span>.<br/>
