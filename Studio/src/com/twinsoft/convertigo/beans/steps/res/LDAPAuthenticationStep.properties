display_name=LDAP Authentication
short_description=Authenticates an user against an LDAP server. | If the user is authenticated its ID is set in current context/session and thereby the current context/session is authenticated. <br/>\
The user ID is set using the <b>Login</b> property. and the LDAP password is set by the <b>password</b> property<br/>\
<span class=\"orangetwinsoft\">Note:</span> Although its <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">false</span> by default, this step generates an <span class="computer">LDAPAuthenticated</span> XML Element in output, that should always contain the user ID value if the step succeeds.\
<br />The generated XML element has a <span class="computer">userDn</span> XML Attribute which contain the distinguished name (dn) associated if one was found in the directory. \  
property.server.display_name=LDAP servers
property.server.short_description=Defines the comma separated server URLs to use. | This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the user ID to set in authentication. <br/>\
A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a default text value, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
<br/>\
LDAP server can be defined as a DNS name or IP address , default port is 389.\
<span class=\"orangetwinsoft\">Note:</span> If you use the <b>source</b> type for this property, the XPath application on target XML should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.
property.login.display_name=LDAP user login
