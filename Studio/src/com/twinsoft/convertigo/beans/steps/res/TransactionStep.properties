display_name=Call Transaction
short_description=Defines a step invoking a transaction. | The <i>Call Transaction</i> step enables to call any existing transaction from the same project or another. It provides input variables to the target transaction, and returns XML data from the call.<br/>\
Variables to be used for the call must be described at step level by adding <i>Variables</i> child objects. You can manually set variables or use the <b>Import variables from the target transaction</b> contextual menu to automatically copy the variable definitions from the target transaction.<br/>\
The target transaction returns structured XML data, its XML schema has to be generated while developing the transaction and is automatically imported to the <i>Call Transaction</i> step while configuring its <b>Transaction</b> property. Thus, the transaction's schema is known by the calling step and elements from the transaction result can be correctly sourced from it.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 A <i>Call Transaction</i> step with all its properties filled and including the target variables can be easily created at once in the Convertigo Studio <b>Projects</b> view. To do so, drag-and-drop with <span class="computer">Ctrl</span> key pressed a transaction from its parent connector to a sequence or a block step where the <i>Call Transaction</i> step has to be created.<br/>\
 \u2022 The client/server HTTP session of parent sequence is spread to the called transaction context, even if it is called internally (<b>Internal invoke</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).<br/>
property.sourceTransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.sourceTransaction.short_description=Defines the target project, connector from this project and transaction to request. | The target transaction must be one of the transactions of one of the connectors from an existing project, the project in which the <i>Call Sequence</i> step is added or another project opened in the same Convertigo. <br/>\
This property is set by selecting the target transaction in a list of values of the following form: <span class="computer"><project_name>.<connector_name>.<transaction_name></span> to avoid mistakes in case of transactions with the same name in several projects.
property.connectionStringDefinition.display_name=Connection string
property.connectionStringDefinition.short_description=Replaces the connection parameters of target connector. | The connection string represents different data depending on connector type:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <i>HTTP / HTML connector</i>: replaces the connector URL string made up of the connector's <b>Server</b> name, server <b>Port</b>, <b>Root path</b> and transaction's <b>Sub path</b> properties.<br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Javelin connector</i>: replaces the address set in the <b>Connection address</b> property, made up of <b>Connection parameter</b>, <b>Host name</b>, host <b>Port</b> and <b>Connection type</b> sub properties.<br/>
