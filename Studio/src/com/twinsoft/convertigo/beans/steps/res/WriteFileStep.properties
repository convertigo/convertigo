display_name=Write File
short_description=Writes XML content in a file.
property.dataFile.display_name=Output file
property.dataFile.short_description=Defines the output file path including the file name. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path and name of the file to write. <br/>\
This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:\
<ul><li><span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,</li>\
<li><span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. </li></ul>
property.appendTimestamp.display_name=Append timestamp
property.appendTimestamp.short_description=Defines whether the file name should be created with a timestamp. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the date is concatenated to the file name in <span class="computer">yyyymmddHHmmssSSS</span> format.
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source data to write. | This property allows defining a list of nodes from a previous step used as data root to be written in the file. <br/>\
A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the XML output document of the sequence (i.e., sequence resulting XML) is used as source. In this case, the step behavior can be seen as a sequence output dump. <br/>\
If REST or SOAP interfaces are used to call parent sequence, the XML output document is normally returned to the sequence caller. 
property.encoding.display_name=Encoding
property.encoding.short_description=Defines the encoding used in output file. | Default used encoding is <span class="computer">ISO-8859-1</span>.
property.appendResult.display_name=Append Result
property.appendResult.short_description=Defines whether the XML must be appended at the end of the file. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, and if the file exists, the step appends the XML at the end of the file. If set to <span class="computer">false</span>, it overrides the current file content.
