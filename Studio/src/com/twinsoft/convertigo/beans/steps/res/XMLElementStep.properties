display_name=Element
short_description=Creates an XML element with a text content. | The <i>Element</i> step adds an element node with text content to parent generated XML element in the sequence XML output. <br/>\
The XML element resulting from this step can be output in the response XML of the sequence if the <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, or used as a source by any other following step.<br/>\
The element is named after the value of the <b>Node name</b> property, its value is set thanks to a source defined in <b>Source</b> property. If no source is defined or if its results is empty, the XML element contains the value of the <b>Default value</b> property, if a value is defined in this property. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Child steps can be added under this step to create a data structure.<br/>\
 \u2022 In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>Element</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by a <i>Concat</i> step, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>Concat</b>. \
The <b>Node name</b> property remains the same. The <b>Source</b> and <b>Default value</b> properties are moved to the <i>Concat</i> step as two lines of the list of source items to concat, one with a source defined and one with a default value defined.<br/>
property.nodeName.display_name=Node name
property.nodeName.short_description=Defines the tag name of the generated XML element. | This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters, <br/>\
 \u2022 it cannot start with a number, <br/>\
 \u2022 it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.<br/>
property.nodeText.display_name=Default value
property.nodeText.short_description=Defines the default text value of the element. | This property allows defining a default value to use when no source is defined or when the source result is empty.
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source to use as value. | This property allows defining a node or a list of nodes from a previous step on which current step works. <br/>\
A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step uses the value defined in <b>Default value</b> property, if a value is defined in this property. Otherwise, the step creates an element with no data.
