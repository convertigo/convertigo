<p>For each authentication certificate, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the certificate file</li>
    <li>Define its type (client or server), its password and eventually its group</li>
    <li>Define its mappings</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
 
<h5>Certificate configuration</h5>                   
<p>
    Configure here the certificates used by Convertigo.<br/>
    The certificates can be <strong>individual certificates files</strong> (*.pfx, *.p12 or *.cer) or <strong>certificates store files</strong> (*.store).<br/>
    Usually, individual certificates authenticate clients, certificates stores authenticate servers.                                         
</p>

<button id="certificatesInstall">Install a new certificate</button>
<button id="certificatesRemove">Remove a certificate</button>

 <hr/>
<h5>Mappings configuration</h5>
<p>
    Configure here the mappings between the authentication paths and the corresponding certificates.<br/>
    The mappings could refer to users either anonymous or authenticated by the Carioca/Vic portal.<br/><br/>
    In the case of the identification of anonymous users, you will have to choose the correct Convertigo project.<br/>
    The 'default' project allows the identification on all projects.<br/><br/>
    Otherwise, you will have to choose the virtual server, the authorization group and the related Carioca/Vic user.<br/>
    An empty 'virtual server' field selects all servers, all groups and all users.<br/>
    An empty 'authorization group' field selects all groups and all users of the specified virtual server.<br/>
    An empty 'user' field selects all users of the specified group.
