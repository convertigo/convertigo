display_name=Button
short_description=Adds a button on a legacy screen. | \
 <p>Unlike other rules, the <i>Button</i> extraction rule is not designed to extract data from the green screen, but to add a button on the detected screen.</p>\
 <p>This rule adds a <code>keyword</code> type XML element to the XML document. The <code>keyword</code> XML element is then processed by XSL transformation to display a new button in the HTML page. This element is similar in many ways to the XML elements created by the <i>SNA Commands</i> extraction rule.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> XML elements of the <code>keyword</code> type are handled by the <code>keyword</code> XSL template described in the <code>keyword.xsl</code> file. To change the way buttons are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</p>
property.label.display_name=Button name
property.label.short_description=Defines the text displayed on the button.
property.action.display_name=Action
property.action.short_description=Defines the action triggered when pressing the button. | \
 <p>Action can be:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>a key action as <code>KEY_PF1</code>,</li>\
  <li>the name of a transaction if the <b>Transaction</b> property is set to <code>true</code>.</li>\
 </ul>
property.dotransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.dotransaction.short_description=Defines whether a transaction must be launched when clicking the button. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, defines the launching of the transaction set in the <b>Action</b> property on button click, by adding a <code>dotransaction</code> attribute to the <code>keyword</code> XML element.</p>
property.buttondesc.display_name=Button layout
property.buttondesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the button is to be displayed. | \
 <p>This property allows to position the created button element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value.</p>\
 <p>These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the button.</p>
property.startPattern.display_name=Start pattern
property.startPattern.short_description=Defines the block starting pattern for the rule to be executed. | \
 <p>Deprecated. It is recommended not to edit this property.</p>
property.endPattern.display_name=End pattern
property.endPattern.short_description=Defines the block ending pattern for the rule to be executed. | \
 <p>Deprecated. It is recommended not to edit this property.</p>
