display_name=Button
short_description=Adds a button on a legacy screen. | Unlike other rules, the <i>Button</i> extraction rule is not designed to extract data from the green screen, but to add a button on the detected screen. <br/>\
This rule adds a <span class="computer">keyword</span> type XML element to the XML document. The <span class="computer">keyword</span> XML element is then processed by XSL transformation to display a new button in the HTML page. This element is similar in many ways to the XML elements created by the <i>SNA Commands</i> extraction rule.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">keyword</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">keyword</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">keyword.xsl</span> file. To change the way buttons are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.label.display_name=Button name
property.label.short_description=Defines the text displayed on the button.
property.action.display_name=Action
property.action.short_description=Defines the action triggered when pressing the button. | Action can be: <br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a key action as <span class="computer">KEY_PF1</span>, <br/> \u2022 the name of a transaction if the <b>Transaction</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>.<br/>
property.dotransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.dotransaction.short_description=Defines whether a transaction must be launched when clicking the button. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, defines the launching of the transaction set in the <b>Action</b> property on button click, by adding a <span class="computer">dotransaction</span> attribute to the <span class="computer">keyword</span> XML element.
property.buttondesc.display_name=Button layout
property.buttondesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the button is to be displayed. | This property allows to position the created button element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes. <br/>\
The screen area is defined through four coordinates: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 x (area left corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 y (area upper corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 w (area width), <br/>\
 \u2022 h (area height). <br/>\
<br/>\
All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <span class="computer">-1</span> represents an undefined value. <br/>\
These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the button.
property.startPattern.display_name=Start pattern
property.startPattern.short_description=Defines the block starting pattern for the rule to be executed. | Deprecated. It is recommended not to edit this property.
property.endPattern.display_name=End pattern
property.endPattern.short_description=Defines the block ending pattern for the rule to be executed. | Deprecated. It is recommended not to edit this property.
