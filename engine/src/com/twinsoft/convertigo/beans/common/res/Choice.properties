display_name=Choice
short_description=Lists entries expected in a field. | \
 <p>The <i>Choice</i> extraction rule turns a one-character field whose expected content belongs to a fixed list (for example Y=Yes, N=No) into an XML element of <code>choice</code> type (combo box or radio buttons) with a predefined list of actions.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> XML elements of the <code>choice</code> type are handled by the <code>choice</code> XSL template described in the <code>choice.xsl</code> file. To change the way choices are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</p>
property.separatorChars.display_name=Actions separators
property.separatorChars.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the character(s) separating actions from each others (if applicable). | \
 <p>For example, if the list of choices is (Y=Yes, N=No), the actions separator is ",".</p>\
 <p>This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</p>
property.endPattern.display_name=End pattern
property.endPattern.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the actions block end pattern (if applicable). | \
 <p>For example, if actions are grouped between brackets, the end pattern is the closing bracket. The rule is applied only if the block ends with this pattern.</p>\
 <p>This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</p>
property.separatorCharsForTokens.display_name=Action label separators
property.separatorCharsForTokens.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the character(s) separating a label from the corresponding action value (if applicable). | \
 <p>For example, if the list of choices is (Y=Yes, N=No), the action label separator is "=".</p>\
 <p>This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</p>
property.choiceCharacterPolicy.display_name=Extraction policy
property.choiceCharacterPolicy.short_description=Defines the policy for extracting the action value (one character to send in the field) related to each action of the action list. | \
 <p>This property defines how to find the action value to send in the field corresponding to each action label from the action list. It can take three values:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>index</code>: the action value is its rank in the action list,</li>\
  <li><code>character separator</code>: the action value is separated from its label thanks to a character separator, which is defined in <b>Action label separators</b> property,</li>\
  <li><code>first upper letter</code>: the action value is the first upper letter the action label.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</p>
property.startPattern.display_name=Start pattern
property.startPattern.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the actions block start pattern (if applicable). | \
 <p>For example, if actions are grouped between brackets, the start pattern is the opening bracket. The rule is applied only if the block starts with this pattern.</p>\
 <p>This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</p>
property.tagName.display_name=Tag name
property.tagName.short_description=Defines the tag name of the element generated in output XML after extraction (by default: <code>choice</code>). | \
 <p>By default, the generated element is of <code>choice</code> type. It is processed by the <code>choice</code> XSL template in the <code>choice.xsl</code> file.</p>
property.actions.display_name=Actions
property.actions.short_description=Defines the actions table listing possible actions. | \
 <p>The <b>Actions</b> table is a two-column table:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Label</b>: defines the action label to be displayed in the combo box (for example "Yes"),</li>\
  <li><b>Command</b>: defines the action value to be sent in the field (for example "Y").</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>A new action can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The HTTP headers defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon.</li>\
  <li>This property is used only if actions are not extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <code>false</code>).</li>\
 </ul>
property.actionsFromScreen.short_description=Defines whether options should be retrieved from the screen. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, possible actions are extracted from the screen. Otherwise, actions are as set in the <b>Actions</b> table.</p>
property.actionsFromScreen.display_name=Options from screen
property.radio.display_name=Radio buttons
property.radio.short_description=Defines whether options should be displayed as radio buttons or combo box. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, the extraction rule adds a <code>radio</code> attribute with the value <code>true</code> to the choice XML element. Otherwise, it adds a a <code>radio</code> attribute with the value <code>false</code>.</p>\
 <p>This attribute is processed by the <code>choice</code> XSL template in the <code>choice.xsl</code> file. When attribute value is <code>true</code>, possible actions are displayed as radio buttons, otherwise, possible actions are displayed as a combo box.</p>
