display_name=Choice
short_description=Lists entries expected in a field. | The <i>Choice</i> extraction rule turns a one-character field whose expected content belongs to a fixed list (for example Y=Yes, N=No) into an XML element of <span class="computer">choice</span> type (combo box or radio buttons) with a predefined list of actions.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">choice</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">choice</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">choice.xsl</span> file. To change the way choices are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.separatorChars.display_name=Actions separators
property.separatorChars.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the character(s) separating actions from each others (if applicable). | <br/>\

This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).
property.endPattern.display_name=End pattern
property.endPattern.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the actions block end pattern (if applicable). | <br/>\
For example, if actions are grouped between brackets, the end pattern is the closing bracket. The rule is applied only if the block ends with this pattern. <br/>\
This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).
property.separatorCharsForTokens.display_name=Action label separators
property.separatorCharsForTokens.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the character(s) separating a label from the corresponding action value (if applicable). | <br/>\

This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).
property.choiceCharacterPolicy.display_name=Extraction policy
property.choiceCharacterPolicy.short_description=Defines the policy for extracting the action value (one character to send in the field) related to each action of the action list. | <br/>\
This property defines how to find the action value to send in the field corresponding to each action label from the action list. It can take three values:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">index</span>: the action value is its rank in the action list,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">character separator</span>: the action value is separated from its label thanks to a character separator, which is defined in <b>Action label separators</b> property,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">first upper letter</span>: the action value is the first upper letter the action label. <br/>\
This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).
property.startPattern.display_name=Start pattern
property.startPattern.short_description=When extracting actions from the screen, defines the actions block start pattern (if applicable). | <br/>\
For example, if actions are grouped between brackets, the start pattern is the opening bracket. The rule is applied only if the block starts with this pattern. <br/>\
This property is used only if actions are extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).
property.tagName.display_name=Tag name
property.tagName.short_description=Defines the tag name of the element generated in output XML after extraction (by default: <span class="computer">choice</span>). | By default, the generated element is of <span class="computer">choice</span> type. It is processed by the <span class="computer">choice</span> XSL template in the <span class="computer">choice.xsl</span> file.
property.actions.display_name=Actions
property.actions.short_description=Defines the actions table listing possible actions. | The <b>Actions</b> table is a two-column table:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Label</b>: defines the action label to be displayed in the combo box (for example "Yes"),<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Command</b>: defines the action value to be sent in the field (for example "Y"). <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 A new action can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The HTTP headers defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon. <br/>\
 \u2022 This property is used only if actions are not extracted from screen (<b>Options from screen</b> property set to <span class="computer">false</span>).<br/>
property.actionsFromScreen.short_description=Defines whether options should be retrieved from the screen. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, possible actions are extracted from the screen. Otherwise, actions are as set in the <b>Actions</b> table.

property.radio.display_name=Radio buttons
property.radio.short_description=Defines whether options should be displayed as radio buttons or combo box. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the extraction rule adds a <span class="computer">radio</span> attribute with the value <span class="computer">true</span> to the choice XML element. Otherwise, it adds a a <span class="computer">radio</span> attribute with the value <span class="computer">false</span>. <br/>\
This attribute is processed by the <span class="computer">choice</span> XSL template in the <span class="computer">choice.xsl</span> file. When attribute value is <span class="computer">true</span>, possible actions are displayed as radio buttons, otherwise, possible actions are displayed as a combo box.
