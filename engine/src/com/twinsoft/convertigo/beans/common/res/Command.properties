display_name=Commands
short_description=Defines and handles keywords and commands found in legacy screens. | \
 <p>The <i>Commands</i> extraction rule detects keywords in the screen and transforms them into <code>keyword</code> type blocks.</p>\
 <p>Each keyword must be found in a list provided in the <b>Keywords table</b> parameter of the rule.</p>\
 <p>The rule adds following XML attributes to matching blocks:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>action</code>: the javelin action to be executed on the mainframe,</li>\
  <li><code>data</code>: optional additional data to be sent with the action.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> XML elements of the <code>keyword</code> type are handled by the <code>keyword</code> XSL template described in the <code>keyword.xsl</code> file. To change the way keywords are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</p>
property.caseDependency.display_name=Case dependency
property.caseDependency.short_description=Defines whether letter case should be respected in keyword detection. | \
 <p>If set to <code>false</code>, keywords match even if the case is not similar. For example, <code>pf13</code> and <code>PF13</code> match the <code>PF13</code> keyword.</p>
property.keywordTable.display_name=Keywords table
property.keywordTable.short_description=Defines a list of keywords that can be detected, with replacement texts, optional data to send and associated action. | \
 <p>This property is a list of <i>Keywords</i>. For each <i>Keyword</i> you can define:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Keyword</b>: Keyword string to handle when found in the screen,</li>\
  <li><b>Replace Text</b>: Replacement text for the keyword (hotspot label, optional),</li>\
  <li><b>Sent data</b>: Data to be sent before performing action (optionnal),</li>\
  <li><b>Action</b>: Action key to be pressed when the user clicks on the button (action key corresponding to found keyword).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>A new keyword can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The keywords defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon.</li>\
  <li>The order of the keywords defined in this table is very important, it is used for detection priority. That means if two keywords can match on a block, only the first keyword from this table will be handled for this block.</li>\
 </ul>
