display_name=Container
short_description=Defines a container block grouping blocks together. | \
 <p>The <i>Container</i> extraction rule groups XML elements with same characteristics under a unique container XML element. This container element can be processed by a specific user-defined XSL style sheet.</p>\
 <p>For example, buttons webized via the <i>Command</i> extraction rule can be grouped as a menu and moved where required, or labels and fields composing a form can be grouped together and displayed in a frame.</p>
property.tagName.display_name=XML tag
property.tagName.short_description=Defines the container element XML tag name (default: <code>container</code>). | \
 <p>In order to be processed by XSL template rule, this element should have a specific tag name. This property allows to configure the XML tag name of the created element.</p>
property.containerDesc.display_name=Container layout
property.containerDesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone in which the container has to be displayed. | \
 <p>This property allows to move the created container element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value.</p>\
 <p>These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the container.</p>
