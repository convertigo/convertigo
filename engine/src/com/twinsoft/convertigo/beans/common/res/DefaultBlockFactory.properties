display_name=Default block factory
short_description=The block factory is the process that splits legacy screens into elementary blocks. | For extraction purpose, legacy application screens are broken into elementary entities called <span class="computer">blocks</span>. The process in charge of generating blocks is called <i>Default block factory</i>. <br/>\
The block generation process can be divided into three major steps:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The block factory analyses screen lines.<br/>\
 \u2022 For each line, the block factory extracts character strings having same attributes (text color, background color, bold, blinking...).<br/>\
 \u2022 For each character string having same attributes, the block factory breaks sentences into single words by performing a separation on blank spaces. For example, the sentence <span class="computer">the_nice_hat</span> (where "_" represents a blank space) is divided into five blocks: <span class="computer">the</span>, <span class="computer">_</span>, <span class="computer">nice</span>, <span class="computer">_</span> and <span class="computer">hat</span>. Consecutive blank spaces are grouped into one single block.<br/>
