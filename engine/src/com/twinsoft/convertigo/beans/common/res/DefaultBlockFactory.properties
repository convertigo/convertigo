display_name=Default block factory
short_description=The block factory is the process that splits legacy screens into elementary blocks. | \
 <p>For extraction purpose, legacy application screens are broken into elementary entities called <code>blocks</code>. The process in charge of generating blocks is called <i>Default block factory</i>.</p>\
 <p>The block generation process can be divided into three major steps:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>The block factory analyses screen lines.</li>\
  <li>For each line, the block factory extracts character strings having same attributes (text color, background color, bold, blinking...).</li>\
  <li>For each character string having same attributes, the block factory breaks sentences into single words by performing a separation on blank spaces. For example, the sentence <code>the_nice_hat</code> (where "_" represents a blank space) is divided into five blocks: <code>the</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>nice</code>, <code>_</code> and <code>hat</code>. Consecutive blank spaces are grouped into one single block.</li>\
 </ul>
