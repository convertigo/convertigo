display_name=Field/Text
short_description=Adds a field or text on the webized screen. | \
 <p>Unlike other extraction rules, the <i>Field/Text</i> extraction rule does not extract data from green screen, but adds text elements on screen.</p>\
 <p>This rule adds <code>field</code> or <code>static</code> type XML element to the XML document. These elements are then processed by XSL transformation to display a field or text label in the HTML page.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>XML elements of the <code>field</code> type are handled by the <code>field</code> XSL template described in the <code>field.xsl</code> file. To change the way fields are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li>XML elements of the <code>static</code> type are handled by the <code>static</code> XSL template described in the <code>static.xsl</code> file. To change the way texts are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
 </ul>
property.value.display_name=Value
property.value.short_description=Defines the field or text value, depending on the element type. | \
 <p>If the added element is of:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>field</code> type: the created field is filled with the value.</li>\
  <li><code>static</code> type: the value is added as static text on screen.</li>\
 </ul>
property.type.display_name=Field type
property.type.short_description=Defines the field/text type. | \
 <p>The element can be either of <code>field</code> or of <code>static</code> type.</p>
property.name.display_name=Field name
property.name.short_description=Defines the field name. | \
 <p>When data is submitted by the user through this field, it is sent to Convertigo as a variable named after this property. It can then be used in a transaction. Use the <code>__field_c&lt;column&gt;_l&lt;line&gt;</code> syntax to have Convertigo add data on screen at defined line and column.</p>
property.fielddesc.display_name=Field layout
property.fielddesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the field/text is to be displayed. | \
 <p>This property allows to position the created text or field element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value.</p>\
 <p>These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the element.</p>
property.focus.display_name=Focus on field
property.focus.short_description=Specifies whether the focus must be placed on this field.
property.fieldattrb.display_name=Field attributes
property.fieldattrb.short_description=Defines the generated field/text presentation attributes. | \
 <p>This property allows to configure the presentation attributes to set to the created text/field, for example green text on black background.</p>\
 <p>Presentation attributes to configure are :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Color</b>: <code>Foreground</code> color, <code>Background</code> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".</li>\
  <li><b>Decoration</b>: <code>bold</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>underlined</code>, <code>blink</code>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".</li>\
 </ul>
