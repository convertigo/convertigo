display_name=Image
short_description=Adds an image on a legacy screen. | Unlike other extraction rules, the <i>Image</i> extraction rule is not designed to extract data from the green screen, but to add an image on the detected screen.<br/>\
This rule adds an <span class="computer">image</span> type XML element to the XML document. The <span class="computer">image</span> XML element is then processed by XSL transformation to display the image in the HTML page.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">image</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">image</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">image.xsl</span> file. To change the way images are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.label.display_name=Image label
property.label.short_description=Defines the alternative text displayed when the image is missing.
property.action.display_name=Action
property.action.short_description=Defines the action triggered when clicking on the image. | Action can be: <br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a key action as <span class="computer">KEY_PF1</span>, <br/> \u2022 the name of a transaction if the <b>Transaction</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>.<br/>
property.dotransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.dotransaction.short_description=Defines whether a transaction must be launched when clicking on the image. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, defines the launching of the transaction set in the <b>Action</b> property on image click, by adding a <span class="computer">dotransaction</span> attribute to the <span class="computer">image</span> XML element.
property.imageDesc.display_name=Image layout
property.imageDesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the image is to be displayed. | This property allows to position the added image element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes. <br/>\
The screen area is defined through four coordinates: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 x (area left corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 y (area upper corner), <br/>\
 \u2022 w (area width), <br/>\
 \u2022 h (area height). <br/>\
<br/>\
All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <span class="computer">-1</span> represents an undefined value. <br/>\
These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the image.
property.url.display_name=URL
property.url.short_description=Defines the image URL. | The URL can be defined either as an absolute or as a relative (to the project directory) URL.
property.keepSize.display_name=Keep image size
property.keepSize.short_description=Defines whether the image must be kept to its original size or forced into the image layout. | If set to <span class="computer">false</span>, the image is sized according to the image layout.
property.zOrder.display_name=Z-order
property.zOrder.short_description=Defines the image <span class="computer">z-order</span>. | Filling this property will define a <span class="computer">z-order</span> attribute to the added image. If left empty, no attribute is added to the <span class="computer">image</span> type XML element.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This attribute has to be handled in the webization framework to be taken into account. The <span class="computer">image</span> XSL template doesn't handle this property by default.
