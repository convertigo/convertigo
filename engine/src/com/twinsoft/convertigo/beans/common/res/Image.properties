display_name=Image
short_description=Adds an image on a legacy screen. | \
 <p>Unlike other extraction rules, the <i>Image</i> extraction rule is not designed to extract data from the green screen, but to add an image on the detected screen.</p>\
 <p>This rule adds an <code>image</code> type XML element to the XML document. The <code>image</code> XML element is then processed by XSL transformation to display the image in the HTML page.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> XML elements of the <code>image</code> type are handled by the <code>image</code> XSL template described in the <code>image.xsl</code> file. To change the way images are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</p>
property.label.display_name=Image label
property.label.short_description=Defines the alternative text displayed when the image is missing.
property.action.display_name=Action
property.action.short_description=Defines the action triggered when clicking on the image. | \
 <p>Action can be:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>a key action as <code>KEY_PF1</code>,</li>\
  <li>the name of a transaction if the <b>Transaction</b> property is set to <code>true</code>.</li>\
 </ul>
property.dotransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.dotransaction.short_description=Defines whether a transaction must be launched when clicking on the image. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, defines the launching of the transaction set in the <b>Action</b> property on image click, by adding a <code>dotransaction</code> attribute to the <code>image</code> XML element.</p>
property.imageDesc.display_name=Image layout
property.imageDesc.short_description=Defines the screen zone where the image is to be displayed. | \
 <p>This property allows to position the added image element to a specific area of the screen. The created block will be created with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value.</p>\
 <p>These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the image.</p>
property.url.display_name=URL
property.url.short_description=Defines the image URL. | \
 <p>The URL can be defined either as an absolute or as a relative (to the project directory) URL.</p>
property.keepSize.display_name=Keep image size
property.keepSize.short_description=Defines whether the image must be kept to its original size or forced into the image layout. | \
 <p>If set to <code>false</code>, the image is sized according to the image layout.</p>
property.zOrder.display_name=Z-order
property.zOrder.short_description=Defines the image <code>z-order</code>. | \
 <p>Filling this property will define a <code>z-order</code> attribute to the added image. If left empty, no attribute is added to the <code>image</code> type XML element.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> This attribute has to be handled in the webization framework to be taken into account. The <code>image</code> XSL template doesn't handle this property by default.</p>
