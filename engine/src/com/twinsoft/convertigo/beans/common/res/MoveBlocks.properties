display_name=Move blocks
short_description=Moves blocks in a legacy screen. | \
 <p>The <i>Move blocks</i> extraction rule moves blocks extracted from a legacy screen to a different target position in the screen (defined through the <b>Moving layout</b> property).</p>
property.fielddesc.display_name=Moving layout
property.fielddesc.short_description=Defines the target screen zone for moved blocks. | \
 <p>This property allows to position the moved blocks to a specific area of the screen. The moved blocks will be updated with the specified screen zone values as positioning attributes.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0). <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value.</p>\
 <p>These positioning attributes have to be handled by the XSL template rule that displays the blocks.</p>
property.isrelative.display_name=Relative move
property.isrelative.short_description=Defines whether the move is relative to the original blocks position or not relative. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, blocks are moved from their original position to a number of columns and a number of lines from it. If set to <code>false</code>, blocks are moved at the exact defined position.</p>
