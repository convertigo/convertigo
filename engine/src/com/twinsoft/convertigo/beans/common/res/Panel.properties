display_name=Panel
short_description=Handles screen panels. | The <i>Panel</i> extraction rule allows the grouping of a set of blocks within a panel. It creates a <span class="computer">panel</span> type element surrounding these blocks.<br/>\
The extraction rule is based on remarkable character patterns in order to determine: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the panel position, <br/>\
 \u2022 blocks being a part of it. <br/>\
<br/>\
To determine the panel position, the rule can also use screen attributes. This is mostly the case for 5250 applications, where windows can be displayed with no border characters, but with colored borders.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">panel</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">panel</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">panel.xsl</span> file. To change the way panels are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.bottom.display_name=Panel bottom
property.bottom.short_description=Defines the bottom character (zone 7, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.LowerLeft.display_name=Panel lower left
property.lowerLeft.short_description=Defines the lower left character (zone 6, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.right.display_name=Panel right
property.right.short_description=Defines the right character (zone 5, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.lowerRight.display_name=Panel lower right
property.lowerRight.short_description=Defines the lower right character (zone 8, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.upperRight.display_name=Panel upper right
property.upperRight.short_description=Defines the upper right character (zone 3, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.top.display_name=Panel top
property.top.short_description=Defines the top character (zone 2, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.upperLeft.display_name=Panel upper left
property.upperLeft.short_description=Defines the upper left character (zone 1, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.left.display_name=Panel left
property.left.short_description=Defines the left character (zone 4, see <i>"Panel zone description"</i> table below).
property.minsides.display_name=Minimum number of sides
property.minsides.short_description=Defines the minimum number of sides for a panel to be detected. | By default, the rule needs 4 sides for a panel to be detected. Sometimes, applications display text in borders (Window description for example). Borders might therefore not match exactly the rule parameters, so you can reduce the number of sides and still have the panel detected.
property.removeBlocksInBorder.display_name=Remove blocks in borders
property.removeBlocksInBorder.short_description=If checked, all text blocks found in the panel border are deleted. | In some applications, windows are detected through their colored border, but there can be also text in borders. As a result, the webized screen is of poor quality. Set this parameter to <span class="computer">true</span> to remove text in borders.
property.titleAttribute.display_name=Title attribute 
property.titleAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the title of the panel. | In some applications, a panel can contain a text in the border that corresponds to the window title. This property allows to configure the presentation attributes of this title to differentiate it from the rest of the panel border.<br/>\
Presentation attributes to configure are :\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Color</b>: <span class="computer">Foreground</span> color, <span class="computer">Background</span> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Decoration</b>: <span class="computer">bold</span>, <span class="computer">reverse</span>, <span class="computer">underlined</span>, <span class="computer">blink</span>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account". <br/>
