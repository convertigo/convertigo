display_name=Delete blocks
short_description=Removes blocks from a legacy screen, based on presentation attributes or block position. | \
 <p>To simplify and speed up the process time of other rules, removing useless blocks can be an option. It limits the quantity of generated XML data and optimizes network traffic.</p>\
 <p>By default, the rule is created with the <b>Type</b> property set to <code>[^field]</code>, meaning that the rule does not apply to blocks of <code>field</code> type.</p>\
 <p>The <i>Delete blocks</i> extraction rule is also useful for cleaning up purposes when creating Data integration projects. Data to be kept are tagged using <i>XML Tagname</i> extraction rules, tables are tagged using a <i>Table</i> or <i>Subfile</i> extraction rule, and other resulting blocks are tagged as <code>block</code>. They can then be removed by configuring the <b>Tag name</b> property to <code>block</code>.</p>\
 <p>The <i>Delete blocks</i> extraction rule can also be used to remove portions of a screen not to be displayed (in webization projects).</p>
property.blockTag.display_name=Tag name
property.blockTag.short_description=Defines the tag name of blocks to be removed.
property.lenght.display_name=Length
property.lenght.short_description=Defines the length of blocks (without trailing and ending spaces) to be removed. | \
 <code>-1</code> means an unspecified length (the length criterion is not used), <code>0</code> means that all blocks containing only spaces are deleted.
property.regularExpression.display_name=Content
property.regularExpression.short_description=Defines the regular expression matching the content of block(s) to be removed. | \
 <p>Blocks which content corresponds to this regular expression are removed. For example, if set to <code>TEST</code>, all blocks containing "TEST" are removed.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
