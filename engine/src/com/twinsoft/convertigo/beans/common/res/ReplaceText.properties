display_name=Replace text
short_description=Replaces occurrences of a specific text in a block. | \
 <p>The <i>Replace text</i> extraction rule replaces texts matching the <b>Searched text</b> property in blocks defined by presentation attributes or block position.</p>
property.replacedText.short_description=Defines the text that will be used to replace the searched text.
property.replacedText.display_name=Replacement text
property.searchedText.short_description=Defines the text to be replaced or the regular expression defining text to be replaced. | \
 <p>Depending on <b>Regular expression</b> property, this property contains a text or a regular expression to define the searched text.</p>\
 <p>It is possible to code non ASCII characters using the following syntax:  <code>&#&lt;decimal ASCII code&gt;;</code>. For example, if the searched text is " " and the replaced text is <code>&#160;</code>, the rule will replace all regular spaces in a block with the character of ASCII code 160 representing unbreakable spaces in HTML.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>For more information about regular expression patterns, see the following page: <code>http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html</code>.</li>\
  <li>To test regular expressions, you can use the regular expression tester at the following URL: <code>http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html</code>.</li>\

property.searchedText.display_name=Searched text
property.regExp.display_name=Regular expression
property.regExp.short_description=Defines whether the searched text is a regular expression or not. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, the searched text parameter is a regular expression. This allows more flexibility for text replacements. For example, with 5250 platforms, it is frequent to remove trailing dots at the end of field descriptions. To do this, set this parameter to <code>true</code> and set the searched for text parameter to: <code>\.(\s\.)+</code></p>\
 <p>If set to <code>false</code>, the searched text parameter is a simple text string that will be replaced when present.</p>
