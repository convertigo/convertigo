display_name=Separator
short_description=Defines how separators are materialized in legacy screens. | The <i>Separator</i> extraction rule defines character strings to be considered as separators. It searches the screen for strings made of the same character, like series of "minus" signs ( "----" ), or of underscores ( "____" ).<br/>\
Characters considered as separators are listed in the <b>Separators</b> extraction rule property. The rule matches strings only if they contain at least the number of occurrences (set as value of the <b>Minimum number of occurrences</b> property) in one of the specified delimiters.<br/>\
