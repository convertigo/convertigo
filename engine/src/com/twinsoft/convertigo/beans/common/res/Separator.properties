display_name=Separator
short_description=Defines how separators are materialized in legacy screens. | \
 <p>The <i>Separator</i> extraction rule defines character strings to be considered as separators. It searches the screen for strings made of the same character, like series of "minus" signs ( "----" ), or of underscores ( "____" ).</p>\
 <p>Characters considered as separators are listed in the <b>Separators</b> extraction rule property. The rule matches strings only if they contain at least the number of occurrences (set as value of the <b>Minimum number of occurrences</b> property) in one of the specified delimiters.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>The separator element has only one new attribute, <code>width</code>, which represents the length of the separator, that is to say the number of separator characters in the separator string.</li>\
  <li>XML elements of the <code>separator</code> type are handled by the <code>separator</code> XSL template described in the <code>separator.xsl</code> file. To change the way separators are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
