<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\

 \u2022 <span class="computer">From previous block</span>: the tag is named after the previous block content. Can be useful in form-like screen to automatically tag multiple data fields with the label preceding the field. For example:<br/>\
<span class="computer">    Label-01 DATA-01</span><br/>\
<span class="computer">    Label-02 DATA-02</span><br/>\
will be automatically tagged as:<br/>\
<span class="computer">    &lt;Label-01&gt;DATA-01&lt;Label-01&gt;</span><br/>\
<span class="computer">    &lt;Label-02&gt;DATA-02&lt;Label-02&gt;</span><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">From next block</span>: the tag will be set from the next block content<br/>
