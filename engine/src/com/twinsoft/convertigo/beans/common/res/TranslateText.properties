display_name=Translate text
short_description=Translates blocks of text according to a given dictionary. | This rule translates the blocks on which it is applied using a dictionary file that is defined by the <b>Dictionary</b> property. <br/>\
The translation is applied block by block, meaning that the block text content is searched as key in the dictionary to find its translation. Blocks have to be split according to dictionary entries. <br/>\
In order to manage several languages, the dictionary file name can automatically be extended with a "lang" suffix which value is retrieved from the <span class="computer">lang</span> attribute of the document element of the output XML. <br/>\
The <span class="computer">lang</span> attribute of the document element is set by Convertigo using the <span class="computer">__lang</span> reserved parameter value. Once the <span class="computer">__lang</span> reserved parameter is received, the context keeps and re-uses this value in every other transaction/sequence output in the same context. <br/>\
You can also update this attribute by script in a transaction's core. To do so, you can use the following code in one of its handlers: <br/>\
<span class="computer">dom.getDocumentElement().setAttribute("lang", "en-us");</span><br/>\
The dictionary files should always be created with a name of the following form <span class="computer">&lt;baseName&gt;_&lt;lang&gt;.txt</span>, one file by needed language. <br/>\
One dictionary file should define all text matches between the original application language and the output language. It should be written using the following format: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the original text/word on a first line, <br/>\
 \u2022 the translated text/word on a second line, <br/>\
 \u2022 an empty line as separator, <br/>\
 \u2022 etc. <br/>\
<br/>\
Not found texts/words will appear in the Convertigo engine logs and may be automatically listed in an orphans file, depending on the <b>Generate orphans list</b> property value.
property.dictionary.display_name=Dictionary base path
property.dictionary.short_description=Base path used to retrieve the dictionary file read for the translations. | This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. <br/>\
<br/>\
The dictionary file path includes the path of the folder where the dictionary file can be found, the base name of the file itself, the language and the file extension. It should be of the following form <span class="computer">&lt;basePath&gt;&lt;baseName&gt;_&lt;lang&gt;.txt</span> with: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the <span class="computer">&lt;basePath&gt;</span> being the folder where the dictionary file can be found, <br/>\
 \u2022 the <span class="computer">&lt;baseName&gt;</span> being the dictionary file base name, <br/>\
 \u2022 the <span class="computer">&lt;lang&gt;</span> being overwritten by the <span class="computer">lang</span> attribute value of the document element of the output XML. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This property value should only contain <span class="computer">&lt;basePath&gt;&lt;baseName&gt;</span>, as the language and file extension will be automatically added.
property.generateOrphans.display_name=Generate orphans list
property.generateOrphans.short_description=If true, unknown texts/words are written in a <span class="computer">&lt;basePath&gt;&lt;baseName&gt;_&lt;lang&gt;_orphans.txt</span> file. | Unknown texts/words are block text contents that are not found in the dictionary. This property can be activated in development environment to help the developer finding the dictionary problems or project inconsistencies. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This should be disabled in production environment to preserve resources.
property.encoding.display_name=Encoding
property.encoding.short_description=Defines the encoding used in the dictionary files. | Default value for encoding is <span class="computer">UTF-8</span>.
