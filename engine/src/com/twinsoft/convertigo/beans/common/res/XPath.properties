display_name=XPath
short_description=Defines a criterion based on an XPath for HTML screen classes. |  The <i>XPath</i> criterion allows defining an XPath expression leading to one or several elements of a web page that uniquely identify a given screen class (logo, image, link, field, etc.). <br/>\
Matching condition: The <i>XPath</i> criterion matches when the evaluation of the Xpath expression, defined in <b>XPath</b> property, on the HTML page's DOM gives a non-empty result. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The <i>XPath</i> criterion, together with the <i>URL</i> criterion, are the two only possible criteria for detecting a screen class in CWC and CWI projects.
