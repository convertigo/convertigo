display_name=FullSync connector
short_description=Establishes connections to the NoSQL CouchDB database for FullSync. | \
 <p>FullSync Connector enables reading and writing from the CouchDB database server configured for this Server. The CouchDB server access has to be configured in the engine settings. The FullSync connector supports several types of FullSync transactions to interact with the database. A standard process for using FullSync would be :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Having a Sequence to call some back end data source and read data</li>\
  <li>Use the FullSync Connector to write data to the CouchDB server by using a PostBulkDocuments or a PostDocument transaction</li>\
  <li>Having this data to be replicated to the mobile Device thanks to the replication protocol</li>\
  <li>On the mobile device the user can modify and update local data</li>\
  <li>Data is replicated back to the CouchDB server</li>\
  <li>A FullSync listener will call an Update sequence with all the updated data</li>\
  <li>This sequence is responsible to update data in the back end system.</li>\
 </ul>
property.anonymousReplication.display_name=Anonymous Replication
property.anonymousReplication.short_description=Allow or deny pull synchronization for a non authenticated session. | \
 <p>This property can be <code>allow</code> and anonymous user (no authenticated user) can pull replicate the FullSync database. The property can be <code>deny</code> and an authenticated user session is mandatory for pull synchronization.</p>
