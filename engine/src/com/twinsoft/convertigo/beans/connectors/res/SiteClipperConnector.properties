display_name=Site Clipper connector
short_description=Establishes connections and clips entire websites through Convertigo. | <i>Site Clipper connector</i> gives access to websites through Convertigo and allows dynamically transforming its pages or resources. It can access websites from several domains. <br/>\
All tasks (screen classes detection, data transformation, etc.) associated with the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> are carried out as defined in the project thanks to several objects:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Screen classes, <br/>\
 \u2022 Criteria, <br/>\
 \u2022 Rules, <br/>\
 \u2022 Site Clipper transactions.<br/>
property.defaultResponseCharset.display_name=Default response charset
property.defaultResponseCharset.short_description=Defines the default charset used to decode/encode data. | Response data specify their charset in a dedicated header: <span class="computer">Content-Type</span>. This header includes a MIME type and possibly a charset. <br/>\
The <b>Default response charset</b> property defines a default charset to use when response data don't specify their charset. Several values are possible, for example <span class="computer">ISO-8859-1</span> or <span class="computer">UTF-8</span>.
property.domainsListing.display_name=Domains listing
property.domainsListing.short_description=Defines a white and/or black list of domains. | The <i>Site Clipper connector</i> can access websites from several domains. This property allows the Convertigo developer to define a list of domains he wants to filter. <br/>\
For each domain of the list, the <b>Domains listing</b> table contains two columns: <br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Domain</b>: This property is a regular expression tested against the accessed data or resources' domain. If the domain matches the regular expression defined, the behavior depends on the second column's value, i.e. if the domain is black-listed or white-listed.<br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Black listed</b>: This property can be <span class="computer">true</span> for black-listed domain or <span class="computer">false</span> for white-listed domain. <br/><br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span><br/> A new domain can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The domains defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon.<br/>\
For each resource or piece of data accessed, Convertigo tests its domain against each regular expression defined in the list, one by one. When one regular expression matches, Convertigo stops its tests and acts, depending on the <b>Black-listed</b> column value. You can use the "up" and "down" arrows to reorder domains tests priorities. <br/>\
Two behaviors can be defined thanks to this <b>Domains listing</b> property:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Default behavior of the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> is to white-list all unfiltered domains: every browsing in the accessed website passes through Convertigo. Resources and data matching black-listed domains will be accessed directly, not through Convertigo. <br/>\
 \u2022 The opposite behavior can be obtained by defining a black-listing regular expression matching all domains. Then, resources and data matching white-listed domains will be the only ones to be accessed through Convertigo. <br/>\
<br/>\

property.trustAllServerCertificates.display_name=Trust all certificates
property.trustAllServerCertificates.short_description=Defines whether trusted certificates must be checked. | In SSL mode, the server sends existing certificates to Convertigo. In most cases, set this setting to <span class="computer">true</span> to automatically trust all server certificates. If set to <span class="computer">false </span>, target server certificates must be installed in Convertigo.
property.authUser.display_name=Basic/NTLM authentication user
property.authUser.short_description=Defines the user name for basic or NTLM authentication. | This property value is used as user name for basic or NTLM authentication.<br/>
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span><br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The type of authentication is chosen using the <span class="computer">Authentication type</span> property.<br/>\
 \u2022 If you are using basic authentication setting, the target application should accept <span class="computer">WWW-Authenticate</span> header.<br/>\
 \u2022 If you are using NTLM authentication setting, do not forget to also fill the <span class="computer">NTLM authentication domain</span> property.<br/>
property.authPassword.display_name=Basic/NTLM authentication password
property.authPassword.short_description=Defines the user's password for basic or NTLM authentication. | This property value is used as user password for basic or NTLM authentication.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span><br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The type of authentication is chosen using the <span class="computer">Authentication type</span> property.<br/>\
 \u2022 If you are using basic authentication setting, the target application should accept <span class="computer">WWW-Authenticate</span> header.<br/>\

property.authenticationType.display_name=Authentication type
property.authenticationType.short_description=Defines the authentication type between basic and NTLM authentications. | This property allows to define which type of authentication has to be used for the HTTP request. Default value is <span class="computer">Basic</span>.<br/>\
If <span class="computer">Basic/NTLM authentication user</span> and <span class="computer">Basic/NTLM authentication password</span> properties are not filled, no authentication is performed. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span><br/><br/>\
 \u2022 If you are using basic authentication setting, the target application should accept <span class="computer">WWW-Authenticate</span> header.<br/>\
 \u2022 If you are using NTLM authentication setting, do not forget to also fill the <span class="computer">NTLM authentication domain</span> property.<br/>
property.NTLMAuthenticationDomain.display_name=NTLM authentication domain
property.NTLMAuthenticationDomain.short_description=Defines the NTLM authentication domain in case of NTLM authentication. | This property value is used as user domain for NTLM authentication. <br/>\
