property.reverseResult.display_name=Reverse result
property.reverseResult.short_description=Defines if the criteria's result should be reversed. | \
 <p>When a criteria is evaluated, it can sometimes be useful to get the opposite of the standard result (i.e. when the criteria matches, its result is false, and when it doesn't match, its result is true). Use this property to reverse the standard result.</p>\
 <p>For example, you may define a screen class that does not contain the text "Hello" in white on black background. For that, you define a criterion matching on the text "Hello" in white on black background, and you reverse it thanks to this property.</p>
