display_name=Variable
short_description=Defines a variable. | A <i>Variable</i> can accept a unique value or a list of values. <br/>\
The default value to use is specified by the <b>Default value</b> property.
property.description.display_name=Description
property.description.short_description=Describes the variable. | This property is used to describe the variable in the widget generated from its parent transaction (or sequence) in Convertigo Mashup Composer.
property.value.display_name=Default value
property.value.short_description=Defines the variable's default value(s). | This property allows defining a default value or default list of values to use when no variable value is provided to the parent transaction (or sequence). <br/>\
A variable is always created with a default value set to <span class="computer">null</span>, which means that the variable is only declared and has no default value. <br/>\
At run time, Convertigo looks for the variable among the query parameters, the JavaScript scope or the objects in the context to retrieve its value. If the variable is found, its value is used, if not found, the default value specified by this property is used. <br/>\
In this last case, and if the default value of the variable is not set (<b>Default value</b> property set to <span class="computer">null</span>), an exception can be thrown by any object or JavaScript code trying to use the undefined variable. <br/>\
It is up to the Convertigo developer to unset the variable's <span class="computer">null</span> value, i.e. to set a default value to the variable. He should prefer using a <i>Test Case</i> to test specific values for the variable or pass a variable value directly when invoking the transaction (or sequence). <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> To unset the <span class="computer">null</span> value of the property, click on the cross-shaped button in the field. Then, the default value is an empty string. You can use it as is or add a value.
property.visibility.display_name=Visibility
property.visibility.short_description=Defines the variable's visibility. | This property allows defining whether the variable's value is masked or not in:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">log files</span>: selecting this option will mask the variable's value that may be printed in all loggers,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">studio user interface</span>: selecting this option will mask the variable's value in the <b>Properties</b> view from the Studio, as well as in the tree of the <b>Projects</b> view,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">platform user interface</span>: selecting this option will mask the variable's value in the test platform of the project and when editing the project in Convertigo web administration,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">project's XML files</span>: selecting this option will mask the variable's value in the project's XML files generated on the file system when saving the objects from the project. <br/>\
<br/>\
Any combination of these options can be chosen, it allows to customize precisely the variable's value display. A last option is available: <span class="computer">Mask value in all</span>. Selecting this option will mask the variable's value in all previously described cases.
property.bsoaparray.display_name=Soap array
property.bsoaparray.short_description=Defines if the multi-valued variable should be seen as a Soap Array of a occurrence of variables. | In the case of transaction or sequence defined as a public SOAP method, this property allows to specify of the current multi-valued variable has to be seen in SOAP envelope as a Soap Array with multiple values inside it or as an occurrence of identical variables.
property.required.display_name=isRequired
property.required.short_description=Defines whether the variable is required. |
