property.targetFilter.display_name=Filter
property.targetFilter.short_description=Defines the target design document's filter from this connector to query. The default '_doc_ids' filter is like a "listen changes for all documents". A custom filter can be use but they must include this code in order to filter actual changes: var doc_ids = JSON.parse(req.body)["doc_ids"]; for (var i = 0; i < doc_ids.length; i++) { &nbsp;&nbsp;if (doc_ids[i] == doc._id) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// put your condition here &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true; &nbsp;&nbsp;} }
