display_name=FullSync Delete Listener View
short_description=Defines a FullSync synchronization listener for deleted documents (by view). | \
 <p>A <b>FullSync Delete Listener View</b> is a listener which helps handling synchronization for a FullSync database.</p>\
 <p>A FullSync listener will associate a view and a sequence in this way:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>When a removed document on the mobile device is replicated on Convertigo Server the listener will call its view passing the docid</li>\
  <li>The View is responsible for filtering the document, for example testing if this document belongs to a specific family or type</li>\
  <li>The Listener's sequence will be called with a list of every document returned by the view so that the sequence can delete data in the back-end applications. The document list will be in a single valued input variable named 'doc'. In your delete sequence, use an iterator to iterate on each 'item' to handle the delete of each document on the back-end</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>It is very important that the views used by listeners have their index based on docids. So, the map function of a 'listenable' view must be be in this form :<code>emit(doc._id, ....)< /code></p>
