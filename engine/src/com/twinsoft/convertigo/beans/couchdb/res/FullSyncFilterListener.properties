display_name=FullSync Update Listener Filter
short_description=Defines a FullSync synchronization listener for updated documents (by filter). | A <b>FullSync Update Listener Filter</b> is a listener which helps handling synchronization for a FullSync database.<br/>\
A FullSync listener will associate a filter and a sequence in this way:<br/><br/>\
 \u2022  When a modified or created document on the mobile device is replicated on Convertigo Server the listener will call its filter passing the docid<br/>\
 \u2022  The Filter is responsible for filtering the document, for example testing if this document belongs to a specific family or type<br/>\
 \u2022  The Listener's sequence will be called with a list of every document returned by the filter so that the sequence can update data in the back-end applications. \
 The document list will be in a single valued input variable named 'doc'. In your Update sequence, use an iterator to iterate on each 'item' to handle the update of each document on the back-end<br/><br/>\
