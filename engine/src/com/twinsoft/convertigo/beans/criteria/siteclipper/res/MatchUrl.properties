display_name=URL
short_description=Defines a request criterion based on URL for Site Clipper screen classes. | The <i>URL</i> criterion allows defining a regular expression that is applied on request URL. <br/>\
By default, the regular expression is tested on base URL. The query string can be added to the tested URL thanks to the <b>Include query string</b> property. <br/>\
Matching condition: The <i>URL</i> criterion matches when the regular expression defined in <b>Regular expression</b> property matches request URL, i.e. if the string pattern described by the regular expression is found in the request URL.
property.includeQuery.display_name=Include query string
property.includeQuery.short_description=Defines whether the query string should be concatenated to the base URL for detection. | If this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the query string, if existing, is concatenated to the base URL before the <b>Regular expression</b> is applied.
