 <p>The <i>URL</i> criterion allows defining a regular expression that is applied on request URL.</p>\
 <p>By default, the regular expression is tested on base URL. The query string can be added to the tested URL thanks to the <b>Include query string</b> property.</p>\
 <p>Matching condition: The <i>URL</i> criterion matches when the regular expression defined in <b>Regular expression</b> property matches request URL, i.e. if the string pattern described by the regular expression is found in the request URL.</p>

 <p>If this property is set to <code>true</code>, the query string, if existing, is concatenated to the base URL before the <b>Regular expression</b> is applied.</p>
