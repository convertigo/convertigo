property.isFinal.short_description=Defines if the extraction is final, i.e. whether pending extraction rules should try to match on the current extraction rule matching blocks. | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, once the rule applies on a matching block, Convertigo doesn't apply the following rules on this block. This can be used to prevent a block from being modified by other rules.</p>
property.isFinal.display_name=Is final
property.selectionAttribute.display_name=Attributes
property.selectionAttribute.short_description=Defines the presentation attributes on which the rule applies, i.e. the rule applies on blocks matching these presentation attributes. | \
 <p>This property allows to configure the rule so that it applies only to parts of screens having specific attributes, for example green text on black background.</p>\
 <p>Presentation attributes to configure are :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Color</b>: <code>Foreground</code> color, <code>Background</code> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".</li>\
  <li><b>Decoration</b>: <code>bold</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>underlined</code>, <code>blink</code>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".</li>\
 </ul>
property.selectionType.display_name=Type
property.selectionType.short_description=Defines, using a regular expression, to which block types the rule applies. | \
 <p>For example, if set to:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>static</code>, the rule applies to blocks of <code>static</code> type only.</li>\
  <li><code>static | field</code>, the rule applies to blocks of <code>static</code> or <code>field</code> type only.</li>\
  <li><code>[^field]</code>, the rule applies to all but <code>field</code> type blocks.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>For more information about regular expression patterns, see the following page: <code>http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html</code>.</li>\
  <li>To test regular expressions, you can use the regular expression tester at the following URL: <code>http://www.regular-expressions.info/javascriptexample.html</code>.</li>\
 </ul>
property.selectionScreenZone.display_name=Screen zone
property.selectionScreenZone.short_description=Defines the screen zone on which the rule applies, i.e. the rule applies on blocks completely contained in this screen area. | \
 <p>This property allows to configure the rule so that it applies only to areas of screens. All blocks found within the specified perimeter are matching this screen zone and can be processed by the rule.</p>\
 <p>The screen area is defined through four coordinates:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>x (area left corner),</li>\
  <li>y (area upper corner),</li>\
  <li>w (area width),</li>\
  <li>h (area height).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>All values are given in characters, with the upper left corner being (x=0, y=0).</p>\
 <code>-1</code> represents an undefined value: <code>(x=-1, y=-1, w=-1, h=-1)</code> is an undefined area representing the whole screen, i.e. all blocks, whatever their coordinates, are matching this screen zone and can be processed by the rule.
