property.mashupEventName.display_name=Mashup event
property.mashupEventName.short_description=Defines mashup events dispatched on click. | Mashup events can be of two types:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Calling directly a transaction or a sequence in Convertigo, <br/>\
 \u2022 Launching an event in Mashup Composer.<br/>\
<br/>\
<b>Mashup event</b> property allows to define a combination of one direct call to a Convertigo transaction or sequence and/or one launch of Mashup Composer event. \
Filling this property adds a <span class="computer">mashup_event</span> attribute to the block, containing the previous combination in a JSON syntax of one of the following formats: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">{"requestable":{"__transaction":"&lt;transaction name&gt;","__connector":"&lt;connector name&gt;"}}</span> for a transaction call only, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">{"requestable":{"__sequence":"&lt;sequence name&gt;"}}</span> for a sequence call only, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">{"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}<span class="computer"> for a mashup event only, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">{"requestable":{"__transaction":"&lt;transaction name&gt;","__connector":"&lt;connector name&gt;"},"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}</span> for a transaction call and a mashup event, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">{"requestable":{"__sequence":"&lt;sequence name&gt;"},"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}</span> for a sequence call and a mashup event.<br/>\
<br/> \
This <span class="computer">mashup_event</span> attribute and its content have to be handled by the XSL file applying at the end of the transaction to generate a real Convertigo call and/or Mashup Composer event on click on the displayed object.
