property.mashupEventName.display_name=Mashup event
property.mashupEventName.short_description=Defines mashup events dispatched on click. | \
 <p>Mashup events can be of two types:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Calling directly a transaction or a sequence in Convertigo,</li>\
  <li>Launching an event in Mashup Composer.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><b>Mashup event</b> property allows to define a combination of one direct call to a Convertigo transaction or sequence and/or one launch of Mashup Composer event. Filling this property adds a <code>mashup_event</code> attribute to the block, containing the previous combination in a JSON syntax of one of the following formats:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>{"requestable":{"__transaction":"&lt;transaction name&gt;","__connector":"&lt;connector name&gt;"}}</code> for a transaction call only,</li>\
  <li><code>{"requestable":{"__sequence":"&lt;sequence name&gt;"}}</code> for a sequence call only,</li>\
  <li><code>{"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}</code> for a mashup event only,</li>\
  <li><code>{"requestable":{"__transaction":"&lt;transaction name&gt;","__connector":"&lt;connector name&gt;"},"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}</code> for a transaction call and a mashup event,</li>\
  <li><code>{"requestable":{"__sequence":"&lt;sequence name&gt;"},"event":"&lt;event name&gt;"}</code> for a sequence call and a mashup event.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This <code>mashup_event</code> attribute and its content have to be handled by the XSL file applying at the end of the transaction to generate a real Convertigo call and/or Mashup Composer event on click on the displayed object.</p>
