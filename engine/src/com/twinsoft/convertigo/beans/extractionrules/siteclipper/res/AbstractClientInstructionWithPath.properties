property.targetpath.display_name=JQuery selector
property.targetpath.short_description=JavaScript expression defining a JQuery selector matching the target element from the HTML document. | \
 <p>This property defines a JQuery selector used to retrieve the target element (input field, text area, select, checkbox, radio button, etc.) on the client browser when the page is loaded. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a string to be used as a JQuery selector.</p>\
 <p>Here are some default syntaxes for JQuery selectors.</p>\
 <p>An id selector starts with <code>#</code> character, an attribute selector is between <code>[]</code> characters, a class selector starts with <code>.</code> character.</p>\
 <p>The <code>&gt;</code> character separating several selectors defines a constraint to the direct ancestor. The space character separating several selectors defines a constraint to any ancestor.</p>\
 <p>The followings are some simple selectors that can be used in JQuery:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Select an element by id: <code>#the_id_to_search</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select an any type of element by name: <code>[name="the_name_to_search"]</code> or also <code>*[name="the_name_to_search"]</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select an input element by name: <code>input[name="the_name_of_the_input_to_search"]</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select an any type of element by class: <code>.class_to_search</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select a div element by class: <code>div.class_of_a_div_to_search</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select an input by name, direct child of a form element selected by class: <code>form.form_class &gt; input[name="input_name"]</code>,</li>\
  <li>Select an hidden input, descendant of a specified id: <code>#specified_id input[type="hidden"]</code>.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The full JQuery selector documentation is available on the official JQuery website: <code>http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/</code>.</p>
