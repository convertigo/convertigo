property.targetpath.display_name=JQuery selector
property.targetpath.short_description=JavaScript expression defining a JQuery selector matching the target element from the HTML document. | This property defines a JQuery selector used to retrieve the target element (input field, text area, select, checkbox, radio button, etc.) on the client browser when the page is loaded. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a string to be used as a JQuery selector. <br/>\
Here are some default syntaxes for JQuery selectors. <br/>\
An id selector starts with <span class="computer">#</span> character, an attribute selector is between <span class="computer">[]</span> characters, a class selector starts with <span class="computer">.</span> character. <br/>\
The <span class="computer">&gt;</span> character separating several selectors defines a constraint to the direct ancestor. The space character separating several selectors defines a constraint to any ancestor. <br/>\
The followings are some simple selectors that can be used in JQuery: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Select an element by id: <span class="computer">#the_id_to_search</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select an any type of element by name: <span class="computer">[name="the_name_to_search"]</span> or also <span class="computer">*[name="the_name_to_search"]</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select an input element by name: <span class="computer">input[name="the_name_of_the_input_to_search"]</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select an any type of element by class: <span class="computer">.class_to_search</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select a div element by class: <span class="computer">div.class_of_a_div_to_search</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select an input by name, direct child of a form element selected by class: <span class="computer">form.form_class &gt; input[name="input_name"]</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 Select an hidden input, descendant of a specified id: <span class="computer">#specified_id input[type="hidden"]</span>. <br/>\
