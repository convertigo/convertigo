display_name=Client instruction click
short_description=Automatically clicks on a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | \
 <p>The <i>Client instruction click</i> extraction rule stores an instruction of clicking on an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of clicking on an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser.</p>\
 <p>The target element is defined thanks to the <b>JQuery selector</b> property. This property is a JavaScript expression, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied.</p>\
 <p>In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, <code>client instruction engine</code> code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the <code>client instruction engine</code> runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules.</p>\
 <p>Consuming the <i>Client instruction click</i> instruction, the engine selects the target element using the <b>JQuery selector</b> and clicks on it.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The click is perfomed using the JQuery <code>click</code> function. For more information about this function, see the following page: <code>http://api.jquery.com/click/</code>.</p>
