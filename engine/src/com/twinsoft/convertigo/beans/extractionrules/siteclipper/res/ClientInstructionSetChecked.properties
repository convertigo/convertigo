display_name=Client instruction set checked
short_description=Automatically checks a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | The <i>Client instruction set checked</i> extraction rule stores an instruction of checking/unchecking an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of checking/unchecking an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser. <br/>\
The target element (checkbox or radio button) is defined thanks to the <b>JQuery selector</b> property and the state to which change the element is defined by the <b>Checked state</b> property. These properties are JavaScript expressions, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied. <br/>\
In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, <span class="computer">client instruction engine</span> code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the <span class="computer">client instruction engine</span> runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules. <br/>\
Consuming the <i>Client instruction set checked</i> instruction, the engine selects the target element using the <b>JQuery selector</b> and depending on the <b>Checked state</b> property value: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 sets the attribute <span class="computer">checked="checked"</span> on the target element, if the <b>Checked state</b> evaluation is <span class="computer">true</span>, <br/>\
 \u2022 removes the <span class="computer">checked</span> attribute from the target element otherwise.<br/>
property.targetvalue.display_name=Checked state
property.targetvalue.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the boolean value used to change the target element state. | This property defines the checked state to set on the target element. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a boolean to be used as follows: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">true</span> for checked state, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">false</span> for unchecked state. <br/>\
<br/>\
The target element should be an <span class="computer">INPUT</span> element of <span class="computer">checkbox</span> or <span class="computer">radio</span> type.
