display_name=Client instruction set checked
short_description=Automatically checks a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | \
 <p>The <i>Client instruction set checked</i> extraction rule stores an instruction of checking/unchecking an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of checking/unchecking an element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser.</p>\
 <p>The target element (checkbox or radio button) is defined thanks to the <b>JQuery selector</b> property and the state to which change the element is defined by the <b>Checked state</b> property. These properties are JavaScript expressions, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied.</p>\
 <p>In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, <code>client instruction engine</code> code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the <code>client instruction engine</code> runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules.</p>\
 <p>Consuming the <i>Client instruction set checked</i> instruction, the engine selects the target element using the <b>JQuery selector</b> and depending on the <b>Checked state</b> property value:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>sets the attribute <code>checked="checked"</code> on the target element, if the <b>Checked state</b> evaluation is <code>true</code>,</li>\
  <li>removes the <code>checked</code> attribute from the target element otherwise.</li>\
 </ul>
property.targetvalue.display_name=Checked state
property.targetvalue.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the boolean value used to change the target element state. | \
 <p>This property defines the checked state to set on the target element. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a boolean to be used as follows:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>true</code> for checked state,</li>\
  <li><code>false</code> for unchecked state.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>The target element should be an <code>INPUT</code> element of <code>checkbox</code> or <code>radio</code> type.</p>
