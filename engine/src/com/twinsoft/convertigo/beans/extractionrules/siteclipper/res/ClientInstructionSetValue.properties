display_name=Client instruction set value
short_description=Automatically sets a value in a target element from a web page accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. The action is performed in the client browser after the page is loaded. | \
 <p>The <i>Client instruction set value</i> extraction rule stores an instruction of setting a value in an element in a queue of client instructions. This queue is then unstacked when the page is client-side loaded. The instruction of setting a value in a target element is performed on the page when it is loaded by the client browser.</p>\
 <p>The target element (input field or text area) is defined thanks to the <b>JQuery selector</b> property and the value to enter in the field is defined by the <b>Value</b> property. These properties are JavaScript expressions, evaluated by Convertigo when the extraction rule is applied.</p>\
 <p>In order to process the unstacking of client instructions in the web page, <code>client instruction engine</code> code is injected into the page after all response extraction rules are applied. When the page is client-side loaded, the <code>client instruction engine</code> runs and consumes each registered client instruction, in the same order as extraction rules.</p>\
 <p>Consuming the <i>Client instruction set value</i> instruction, the engine selects the target element using the <b>JQuery selector</b> and sets the <code>value</code> attribute with the value computed by the rule using the <b>Value</b> property.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The value is set using the JQuery <code>val</code> function. For more information about this function, see the following page: <code>http://api.jquery.com/val/</code>.</p>
property.targetvalue.display_name=Value
property.targetvalue.short_description=JavaScript expression defining the string value to set in the target element. | \
 <p>This property defines the value to be entered in the target element. It is defined thanks to a JavaScript expression evaluated using the JavaScript scope of the current context. It should return a string to be used as a text value.</p>\
 <p>The target element should be:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>an <code>INPUT</code> element of <code>text</code>, <code>hidden</code> or <code>password</code> type,</li>\
  <li>a <code>SELECT</code> element,</li>\
  <li>a <code>TEXTAREA</code> element.</li>\
 </ul>
