display_name=Rewrite absolute URL
short_description=Rewrites absolute URLs found in a Site Clipper response. | The <i>Rewrite absolute URL</i> extraction rule rewrites absolute URLs found in Site Clipper HTTP responses, for the links or resources accessed by these URLs to be accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper. <br/>\
This extraction rule will be executed only on HTTP responses that match certain MIME types:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 If <b>Rewrite HTML code</b> property value is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, URLs found in HTML code are rewritten. That means the extraction rule is searching for URLs to rewrite in HTTP responses of <span class="computer">text/html</span> or <span class="computer">application/xhtml+xml</span> MIME types. <br/>\
 \u2022 If <b>Rewrite CSS code</b> property value is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, URLs found in CSS code are rewritten. That means the extraction rule is searching for URLs to rewrite in HTTP responses of <span class="computer">text/css</span>, <span class="computer">text/html</span> or <span class="computer">application/xhtml+xml</span> MIME types.<br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span>\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 Absolute URLs are rewritten only if they don't match a black listed domain defined in the <b>Domains listing</b> property of the associated <i>Site Clipper connector</i>.<br/>\
 \u2022 If applicable, relative URLs are rewritten to absolute ones. <br/>\
 \u2022 URLs found in JavaScript code will not be rewritten by this rule. To do so, use a <i>Replace string</i> extraction rule parametered for your specific case.<br/>
