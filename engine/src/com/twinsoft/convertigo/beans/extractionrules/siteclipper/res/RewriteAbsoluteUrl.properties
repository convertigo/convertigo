display_name=Rewrite absolute URL
short_description=Rewrites absolute URLs found in a Site Clipper response. | \
 <p>The <i>Rewrite absolute URL</i> extraction rule rewrites absolute URLs found in Site Clipper HTTP responses, for the links or resources accessed by these URLs to be accessed through Convertigo Site Clipper.</p>\
 <p>This extraction rule will be executed only on HTTP responses that match certain MIME types:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>If <b>Rewrite HTML code</b> property value is set to <code>true</code>, URLs found in HTML code are rewritten. That means the extraction rule is searching for URLs to rewrite in HTTP responses of <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> MIME types.</li>\
  <li>If <b>Rewrite CSS code</b> property value is set to <code>true</code>, URLs found in CSS code are rewritten. That means the extraction rule is searching for URLs to rewrite in HTTP responses of <code>text/css</code>, <code>text/html</code> or <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> MIME types.</li>\
 </ul>\

 <ul>\
  <li>Absolute URLs are rewritten only if they don't match a black listed domain defined in the <b>Domains listing</b> property of the associated <i>Site Clipper connector</i>.</li>\
  <li>If applicable, relative URLs are rewritten to absolute ones.</li>\
  <li>URLs found in JavaScript code will not be rewritten by this rule. To do so, use a <i>Replace string</i> extraction rule parametered for your specific case.</li>\
