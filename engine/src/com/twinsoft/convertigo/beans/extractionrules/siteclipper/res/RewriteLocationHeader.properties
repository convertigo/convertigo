display_name=Rewrite location header
short_description=Rewrites the "<code>Location</code>" header value of a Site Clipper response. | \
 <p>The <i>Rewrite location header</i> extraction rule rewrites the "<code>Location</code>" header value of a Site Clipper response.</p>\
 <p>This response header is mostly used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the requested one for completion of the request or identification of a new resource. The extraction rule rewrites this URL in order to access the new location through Convertigo Site Clipper.</p>\
 <p>The <i>Rewrite location header</i> extraction rule's behavior depends on the type of URL found in the header. If the URI specified by the location's value is absolute, two cases are possible:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>if the URI doesn't match a black listed domain defined in <i>Site Clipper connector</i>, the header value is automatically rewritten,</li>\
  <li>else, the header value remains unchanged.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>If the URI specified by the location's value is relative, it is automatically rewritten.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> If applicable, location's URI is rewritten to an absolute value so that next client's request for the given resource is correctly handled by Convertigo.</p>
