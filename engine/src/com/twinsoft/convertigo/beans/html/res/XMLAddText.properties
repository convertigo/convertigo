display_name=Add text
short_description=Adds HTML text under a node. | The <i>Add text</i> extraction rule adds an HTML text element (<span class="computer">P</span> tag with text content) in the XHTML content clipped by a <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule. <br/>\
It is part of the set of <b>Web Clipping</b> extraction rules adding content into the XHTML content of a previously executed <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule, such as:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Add link</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Add Image</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Add button</i>. <br/>\
<br/>\
Such extraction rules change the XHTML content resulting from the execution of a <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule, by adding specific XHTML content based on defined parameters.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The <b>XPath</b> property set for such extraction rules must be valid in the XHTML output resulting from the <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule and possibly modified by previous rules.<br/>\
 \u2022 If a list of nodes are matching the defined Xpath, the <i>Add text</i> extraction rule will only add one text under the first matching node.<br/>
property.text.display_name=Text
property.text.short_description=Defines the text content to add. | Depending on the extraction rule, it is:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the added text, for <i>Add text</i> rule, <br/>\
 \u2022 the link displayed text, for <i>Add link rule</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 the added image label and alternative text, for <i>Add image</i> and <i>Add button</i> rules.<br/>
