display_name=Delete nodes
short_description=Removes identified nodes from the XML output document. | The <i>Delete nodes</i> extraction rule deletes all nodes matching the Xpath defined in the <b>XPath</b> property set for the rule. Nodes are deleted from the XML output generated by a previously executed <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule.<br/>\
When setting a <i>Web Clipper</i> extraction rule, it is sometimes impossible to avoid clipping unwanted elements. This rule allows to delete them following their extraction.
