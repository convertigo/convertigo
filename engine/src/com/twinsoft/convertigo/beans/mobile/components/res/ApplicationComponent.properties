display_name=Ionic3App
short_description=Defines the mobile <i>Ionic3App</i> component. | An application represents the whole application with all the components needed to build it (pages, menus, routes, styles and theme). \
<br/>The <i>Ionic3App</i> component is also used to control how the application viewer is launched (Right click) : \
<br> \u2022 Execute : runs the application in the App viewer. Will use the current build mode (Fast, Debug, Debug plus, production)\
<br> \u2022 Update packages and Execute : Will update NPM dependencies for your project and run the app. Use this if you want to be sure your NPM dependencies is up to date\
<br> \u2022 Re-install packages and Execute : Will remove all NPM dependencies and re-install from scratch, then runs the app. Use this to clean your project node_modules directory is case of corrupted NPM installs\
<br/> \
<br /> \
You can also write some Custom Ionic application component code by using the "Edit Application class" menu. This will enable you to run some type script between the marker<br \><br \> \
<code>/* Begin_c8o xxxxxxxxxxx */ </code> and the marker\
<br /> \
<code>/* End_c8o xxxxxxxxxxx */ </code>  <br /> \
<br /> \
The <i>Ionic3App</i> component also defines the <i>Template project</i> property. This represents the Ionic Template your project is based on. A template defines a basic project Convertigo \
Mobile Builder will use to generate your app. Templates are standard Convertigo projects (.CAR files) installed in your workspace. You can have more than one template installed and \
you can choose the one you want to use for your project.By default Convertigo Studio will use the "mobilebuilder_tpl_7_6_0" template for your project. <br /><br /> \
A template also defines all the required basic Framework components and versions your app will require. (Angular, Ionic, components etc ...) so, switching templates will enable you \
to base your app on newer versions of the frameworks just by selecting the required template. Be sure to use the "Update packages and Execute" option to run your app after a template change. \
<br /> \
<br /> \
You can Write your own templates based on the "mobilebuilder_tpl_x_x_x" your application use. Just edit the files in the "ionicTpl" folder (packages.json, or any other source file). This way you \
will have full control on the app and add any required custom code at the place you want.
