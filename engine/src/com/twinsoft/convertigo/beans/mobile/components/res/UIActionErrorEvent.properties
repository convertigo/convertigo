display_name=Error Handler
short_description=Defines an <i>Error Handler</i>. |   <i>Error Handler</i> can be used to Catch any unhandled (not handled by a <i>Failure Handler</i>) error in an Action chain.\
<br/>To do so, place the <i>Error Handler</i> immediately under an <i>Event</i>, an <i>AppEvent</i>, a <i>PageEvent</i>, a <i>SharedAction</i> or a <i>Subscribe Handler</i>.\
<br/>If an unhandled error occurs in the action chain, whatever the depth the error was generated, the actions placed under the <i>Error Handler</i> will be executed. <br /><br /> \
If an error is handled by a <i>Failure Handler</i>, the <i>Error Handler</i> will not be executed unless an <i>Error</i> action is explicitly executed in the <i>Failure Handler</i> chain.<br /><br />\
<i>Error Handler</i> generates a <i>out</i> object containing a message property you can use as a (TS) input for other actions, for example a <i>ToastAction</i>. The message \
will be the one explicitly set by the <i>Error</i> action , or the original error message generated by the failed Action if no <i>Error</i> action has been executed.
