display_name=Error Handler
short_description=Defines an <i>Error Handler</i>. | \
 <p><i>Error Handler</i> can be used to Catch any unhandled (not handled by a <i>Failure Handler</i>) error in an Action chain.</p>\
 <p>To do so, place the <i>Error Handler</i> immediately under an <i>Event</i>, an <i>AppEvent</i>, a <i>PageEvent</i>, a <i>SharedAction</i> or a <i>Subscribe Handler</i>.</p>\
 <p>If an unhandled error occurs in the action chain, whatever the depth the error was generated, the actions placed under the <i>Error Handler</i> will be executed.</p>\
 <p>If an error is handled by a <i>Failure Handler</i>, the <i>Error Handler</i> will not be executed unless an <i>Error</i> action is explicitly executed in the <i>Failure Handler</i> chain.</p>\
 <p><i>Error Handler</i> generates a <i>out</i> object containing a message property you can use as a (TS) input for other actions, for example a <i>ToastAction</i>. The message will be the one explicitly set by the <i>Error</i> action , or the original error message generated by the failed Action if no <i>Error</i> action has been executed.</p>
