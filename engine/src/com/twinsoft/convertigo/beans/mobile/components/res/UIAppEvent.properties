display_name=AppEvent
short_description=Defines an <i>AppEvent</i> component. | \
 <p>App lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation. You may add an <i>AppEvent</i> component under the <b>Application</b> and chain in it any type of <b>action</b> such as <i>CallSequence</i>, <i>CallFulSync</i> or <i>CustomAction</i> components.</p>\
 <p>For more information about Ionic events: <a href='https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/api/platform/Platform/' target='_blank'>Platform</a></p>\
 <p>For more information about C8oSdk events: <a href='../../../../../convertigo-mbaas-server/convertigo-client-sdk/' target='_blank'>C8oSdk</a></p>\
 <p>Application Events can be:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>onAppPause</b>: Will be fired when the app is pushed to the background, and not displayed anymore on the screen.</li>\
  <li><b>onAppResume</b>: Will be fired when the app is restored from the backround, and displayed again.</li>\
  <li><b>onAppResize</b>: When the app is resized, for example by swiching to portrait orientation.</li>\
  <li><b>onAutoLogin</b>: Will be fired when performing an automatic 'login' on the server. The resulting data is a Json structure <code>{status:true, response: response, error: null}</code>. If the <code>status</code> is <code>true</code>, you have successfully logged in.</li>\
  <li><b>onSessionLost</b>: When the app looses the session to the Convertigo server. This may occurs if the device gets in offline mode for a time greater than the session timeout property in the Convertigo server project object. If this occurs, you must ensure that you re-execute a 'Login' sequence on the server to re-authenticate the user.</li>\
  <li><b>onNetworkReachable</b>: Will be fired as soon as the app starts and that network connectivity has been tested against Convertigo server endpoint. From this event you can start a login sequence and execute a FullSync 'Sync' Action to sync your data. You are sure that you have network connectivity. This event can be fired again each time lost connectivity is restored and tested again.</li>\
  <li><b>onNetworkUnreachable</b>: Will be fired if you do have network connectivity but that the Convertigo server endpoint is unreachable. For example, connected on a Wifi network unable to route to the server endpoint, or that the Server is not available for any other reason. You should warn the user about this state.</li>\
  <li><b>onNetworkOffline</b>: Will be fired as soon as the device looses network connectivity (Plane mode, or no WIFI/3G/4G network).</li>\
 </ul>
