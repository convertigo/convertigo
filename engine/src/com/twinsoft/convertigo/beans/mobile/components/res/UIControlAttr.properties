short_description=Defines an attribute for a component. | Attributes can be added to any Component. You can add \
your custom attributes to customize a component behavior. For example you can add a "class" attribute to set a custom CSS class \
name to this component. When you set explicitly a class name attribute on a component, the class will be merged with any 'Style' component \
positioned for  this component<br /><br />\
'Attr' components have two properties : \
<br> \u2022 name : the name of the attribute such as 'class' or 'value\
<br> \u2022 value : the value of the attribute\
<br/><br /><br /> \
You can also use attributes to control some explicit behavior for data binding using Angular binding syntax :\
<br> \u2022 [attribute] for data to UI binding\
<br> \u2022 (attribute) for UI to data binding ex: events\
<br> \u2022 [(attribute)] for 2 way bindings ex: [(ngModel)]\
<br/><br /><br /> \
Attribute values can be 'sourced' from any Sequence or from Page class TypeScript properties.
