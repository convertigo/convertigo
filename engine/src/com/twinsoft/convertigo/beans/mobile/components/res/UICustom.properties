display_name=Fragment
short_description=Defines a <i>Fragment</i> component. | \
 <p>This component acts as a standard HTML fragment inside the HTML document.</p>\
 <p>You can use <i>Fragment</i> to write your own custom HTML code in a page. The code you write will be inserted in the page at the level the <i>Fragment</i> is defined.</p>\
 <p>To write the code, double-click on the <i>Fragment</i> component in your project to open the HTML editor.</p>\
 <p>You can directly write in the editor Ionic / Angular Template syntax such as : <br> <pre> &lt;ion-list&gt;</p>\
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;button ion-item *ngFor="let item of items" (click)="itemSelected(item)"&gt;</p>\
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{ item }}</p>\
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/button&gt;</p>\
 <p>&lt;/ion-list&gt;</p>\
 <p></pre></p>\
 <p>You can add other components under a <i>Fragment</i> component, but you need to write some specific code to merge their template inside your fragment : <br> • add <pre>&lt;!--&lt;c8o-sub-bean id="xxx" /&gt;--&gt;</pre> to insert at this level the code of a given child component with id equals to its <i>priority</i> property <br> • add <pre>&lt;!--&lt;c8o-sub-beans /&gt;--&gt;</pre> to insert at this level the code of all or remaining child components</p>\
 <p>Fragments can help advanced developers to customize their applications with the full power of Ionic and Angular frameworks.</p>\
