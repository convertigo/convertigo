display_name=PageEvent
short_description=Defines a <i>PageEvent</i> component. | Page lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation:\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onCanEnter</b><br>Runs before the view can enter. This can be used as a sort of "guard" in authenticated views where you need to check permissions before the view can enter. You must resolve(boolean) from custom action to let enter in the page.\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onCanLeave</b><br>Runs before the view can leave. This can be used as a sort of "guard" in authenticated views where you need to check permissions before the view can leave. You must resolve(boolean) from custom action to let leave the page.\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onDidLoad</b><br>Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing. The onDidLoad event is good place to put your setup code for the page\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onWillEnter</b><br>Runs when the page is about to enter and become the active page\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onDidEnter</b><br>Runs when the page has fully entered and is now the active page. This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onWillLeave</b><br>Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onDidLeave</b><br>Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page\
<br/> \u2022 <b>onWillUnload</b><br>Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed\
<br/> \
You can add a <i>PageEvent</i> component under a <b><i>Page</i></b> or a <b><i>SharedComponent</i></b> component.\
<br> Within a <i>PageEvent</i> component, you can add and chain any type of <b>action</b> such as <i>CallSequence<i>, <i>CallFulSync<i> or <i>CustomAction<i> component.\
