display_name=SharedComponent
short_description=Defines <i>SharedComponent</i> component. | This component helps defining an entire composite component. It will then be available \
to all other pages within your project and to any other project. Using <i>SharedComponent</i>s is the best way to build modular projects \
and provide standard components shared among multiple Projects / Pages.\
<br/><br/>\
<i>SharedComponent</i> objects will be placed in the <b>Shared components</b> folder of your application. Under a <i>SharedComponent</i> you can add any other \
Convertigo Mobile Builder component, such as buttons, list views, styles etc...\
<br/><br/>\
Modifying any component property or adding components to a <i>SharedComponent</i> will automatically rebuild all the pages using it within your project \
or any other project loaded in the workspace using it.\
<br/><br/>\
Components inserted in a <i>SharedComponent</i> can be bound to any standard Mobile Builder source (Sequences, TypeScript, FullSync, Global properties) \
<br/><br/>\
To use a <i>SharedComponent</i> in a page, just insert a <i>UseSharedComponent</i> component in the tree, and select the desired shared component through \
its <i>Shared component</i> property.
