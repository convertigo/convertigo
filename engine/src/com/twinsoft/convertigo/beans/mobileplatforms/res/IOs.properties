short_description=iOS mobile platform | \
 <p><i>iOS</i> mobile platform allows creating an iOS application from the <i>Mobile application</i> below which it is added.</p>\
 <p>The mobile application dedicated to the platform is built from:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>the common resources of the <i>Mobile application</i>, located in <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;/DisplayObjects/mobile</code> (with <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;</code> the root folder of your mobile project resources),</li>\
  <li>and are possibly completed by the resources dedicated to the platform, located in <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;/DisplayObjects/platforms/&lt;platform_object_name&gt;</code> (with <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;</code> the root folder of your mobile project resources, and with <code>&lt;platform_object_name&gt;</code> the resources folder named after your mobile platform object name).</li>\
 </ul>
property.iOSCertificateTitle.display_name=iOS certificate title
property.iOSCertificateTitle.short_description=Defines iOS certificate title to use for building the iOS application from this application. | \
 <p>When building a mobile application for iOS platform, an iOS certificate (including title and password) is mandatory. Convertigo provides one by default, this iOS certificate is used by default in Convertigo engine.</p>\
 <p>This default iOS certificate can be configured at engine level, in the <i>Mobile builder</i> tab of the <i>Administration Console</i>'s <i>Configuration</i> page. This engine level iOS certificate will be used by default for all iOS dedicated applications built by the Convertigo.</p>\
 <p>The <b>iOS certificate title</b> property allows to override the iOS certificate title for this mobile application's build. If left empty, the common iOS certificate title defined at Convertigo engine level is used.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The iOS certificate is linked to a PhoneGap build account. If a <b>Mobile builder authentication token</b> is configured in the <i>Mobile application</i> or at Convertigo engine level, the iOS certificate (defined here or at Convertigo engine level) must be one of the "Signing keys" declared in this PhoneGap build account.</p>
