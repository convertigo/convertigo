 <ul>\
  <li>the common resources of the <i>Mobile application</i>, located in <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;/DisplayObjects/mobile</code> (with <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;</code> the root folder of your mobile project resources),</li>\
  <li>and are possibly completed by the resources dedicated to the platform, located in <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;/DisplayObjects/platforms/&lt;platform_object_name&gt;</code> (with <code>&lt;project_folder&gt;</code> the root folder of your mobile project resources, and with <code>&lt;platform_object_name&gt;</code> the resources folder named after your mobile platform object name).</li>\

This engine level Window Phone publisher ID will be used by default for all Windows Phone dedicated applications built by the Convertigo.</p>\
