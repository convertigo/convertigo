short_description=Defines <i>SharedAction</i> component. | \
 <p>This component helps defining an entire action logic. It is shared between all your applications. <br><br>You can add a <i>SharedAction</i> under an application and use it through an <i>Invoke SharedAction</i> from any application page. <br><br>You may add <i>SharedAction Variable</i>s to pass additional parameters to the executing function of the action. <br><br>To access a shared action <i>SharedAction Variable</i> from any child <i>Action</i> property or variable, use in script mode (TS) : <br> • <code>params.&lt;variable-name&gt;</code> <br> • <code>stack['&lt;shared-action-name&gt;'].in.vars.&lt;variable-name&gt;</code></p>\
 <p><u>For more information</u>: <br>See <i>Invoke SharedAction</i> component <br>See <i>SharedAction Variable</i> component</p>
property.exposed.display_name=Is exposed
property.exposed.short_description=Defines whether the action is exposed for public use. | \
 <p>If exposed, an action can be invoked by any project. It will be visible in the Ngx palette and documented in the generated readme.md file.</p>\
 <p>Otherwise, the action can only be invoked within its own project (through the <i>Shared action</i> picker only). It will not be visible in the Ngx palette, nor documented in the generated readme.md file.</p>
