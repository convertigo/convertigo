display_name=AppEvent
short_description=Defines an <i>AppEvent</i> component. | App lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation. \
You may add an <i>AppEvent</i> component under the <b>Application</b> and chain in it any type of <b>action</b> such as <i>CallSequence</i>, <i>CallFulSync</i> or <i>CustomAction</i> components.\

<br /><br />\
Application Events can be:<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onAppPause</b>: Will be fired when the app is pushed to the background, and not displayed anymore on the screen.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onAppResume</b>: Will be fired when the app is restored from the backround, and displayed again.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onAppResize</b>: When the app is resized, for example by swiching to portrait orientation.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onAutoLogin</b>: Will be fired when performing an automatic 'login' on the server. \
The resulting data is a Json structure <code>{status:true, response: response, error: null}</code>. \
If the <code>status</code> is <code>true</code>, you have successfully logged in.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onSessionLost</b>: When the app looses the session to the Convertigo server. This may occurs if the device gets in offline mode for a \
time greater than the session timeout property in the Convertigo server project object. If this occurs, you must ensure that you \
re-execute a 'Login' sequence on the server to re-authenticate the user.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onNetworkReachable</b>: Will be fired as soon as the app starts and that network connectivity has been tested against Convertigo server \
endpoint. From this event you can start a login sequence and execute a FullSync 'Sync' Action to sync your data. You are sure that you have \
network connectivity. This event can be fired again each time lost connectivity is restored and tested again.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onNetworkUnreachable</b>: Will be fired if you do have network connectivity but that the Convertigo server endpoint is unreachable. \
For example, connected on a Wifi network unable to route to the server endpoint, or that the Server is not available for any other \
reason. You should warn the user about this state.<br /><br />\
\u2022 <b>onNetworkOffline</b>: Will be fired as soon as the device looses network connectivity (Plane mode, or no WIFI/3G/4G network).
