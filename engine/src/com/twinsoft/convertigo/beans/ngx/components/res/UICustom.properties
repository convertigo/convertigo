display_name=Fragment
short_description=Defines a <i>Fragment</i> component. | This component acts as a standard HTML fragment inside the HTML document.\
<br/>You can use <i>Fragment</i> to write your own custom HTML code in a page. The code you write will be inserted in the page \
at the level the <i>Fragment</i> is defined.<br/>To write the code, double-click on the <i>Fragment</i> component in your project to \
open the HTML editor.<br/><br/>\
You can directly write in the editor Ionic / Angular Template syntax such as : <br>\
<pre>\
&lt;ion-list&gt; <br />\
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;button ion-item *ngFor="let item of items" (click)="itemSelected(item)"&gt; <br />\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {{ item }} <br /> \
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/button&gt; <br />\
&lt;/ion-list&gt; <br />\
</pre> \
<br/>You can add other components under a <i>Fragment</i> component, but you need to write some specific code to merge their template inside your fragment :\
<br> \u2022 add <pre>&lt;!--&lt;c8o-sub-bean id="xxx" /&gt;--&gt;</pre> to insert at this level the code of a given child component with id equals to its <i>priority</i> property\
<br> \u2022 add <pre>&lt;!--&lt;c8o-sub-beans /&gt;--&gt;</pre> to insert at this level the code of all or remaining child components\
<br/>\
Fragments can help advanced developers to customize their applications with the full power of Ionic and Angular frameworks.\
