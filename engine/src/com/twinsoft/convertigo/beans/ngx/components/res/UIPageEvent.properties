display_name=PageEvent
short_description=Defines a <i>PageEvent</i> component. | \
 <p>Page lifecycle events are fired during various stages of navigation:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>onCanEnter</b><br>Deprecated - See <i>AppGuard</i> <b>onCanActivate</b>.</li>\
  <li><b>onCanLeave</b><br>Deprecated - See <i>AppGuard</i> <b>onCanDeactivate</b>.</li>\
  <li><b>pageWillLoad</b><br>Runs when the page has initialized. This event only happens once per page being created.</li>\
  <li><b>pageDidLoad</b><br>Runs when the page has loaded. This event only happens once per page being created. If a page leaves but is cached, then this event will not fire again on a subsequent viewing. The onDidLoad event is good place to put your setup code for the page</li>\
  <li><b>pageWillEnter</b><br>Runs when the page is about to enter and become the active page</li>\
  <li><b>pageDidEnter</b><br>Runs when the page has fully entered and is now the active page. This event will fire, whether it was the first load or a cached page</li>\
  <li><b>pageWillLeave</b><br>Runs when the page is about to leave and no longer be the active page</li>\
  <li><b>pageDidLeave</b><br>Runs when the page has finished leaving and is no longer the active page</li>\
  <li><b>pageWillUnload</b><br>Runs when the page is about to be destroyed and have its elements removed</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>You can add a <i>PageEvent</i> component under a <b><i>Page</i></b> or a <b><i>SharedComponent</i></b> component. <br> Within a <i>PageEvent</i> component, you can add and chain any type of <b>action</b> such as <i>CallSequence<i>, <i>CallFulSync<i> or <i>CustomAction<i> component.</p>\
