display_name=SharedTemplate
short_description=Defines <i>SharedTemplate</i> component. | \
 <p>This component helps defining an entire composite component. It will then be available to all other pages within your project and to any other project. Using <i>SharedTemplate</i>s is the best way to build modular projects and provide standard components shared among multiple Projects / Pages.</p>\
 <p><i>SharedTemplate</i> objects will be placed in the <b>Shared components</b> folder of your application. Under a <i>SharedTemplate</i> you can add any other Convertigo Mobile Builder component, such as buttons, list views, styles etc...</p>\
 <p>Modifying any component property or adding components to a <i>SharedTemplate</i> will automatically rebuild all the pages using it within your project or any other project loaded in the workspace using it.</p>\
 <p>Components inserted in a <i>SharedTemplate</i> can be bound to any standard Mobile Builder source (Sequences, TypeScript, FullSync, Global properties)</p>\
 <p>To use a <i>SharedTemplate</i> in a page, just insert a <i>UseSharedComponent</i> component in the tree, and select the desired shared component through its <i>Shared component</i> property.</p>
property.identifier.display_name=Identifier
property.identifier.short_description=Defines the component identifier.
property.exposed.display_name=Is exposed
property.exposed.short_description=Defines whether the component is exposed for public use. | \
 <p>If exposed, a component can be used by any project. It will be visible in the Ngx palette and documented in the generated readme.md file.</p>\
 <p>Otherwise, the component can only be used within its own project (through the <i>Shared component</i> picker only). It will not be visible in the Ngx palette, nor documented in the generated readme.md file.</p>
