display_name=SOAP web service
short_description=References a SOAP web service by creating the <i>HTTP connector</i> with all transactions matching the web service methods, referencing its WSDL file and importing its schemas in this project. | The <i>SOAP web service</i> reference creates an <i>HTTP connector</i> configured to target the web service. It automatically creates <i>XML HTTP transactions</i> for each method described by the web service, including their variables. <br/>\
The <i>SOAP web service</i> reference also enhances the current project's schema by importing the referenced WSDL file's schemas (such as an <i>Import WSDL schema</i> reference). <br/>\
The imported XSD objects (types, elements, groups, ...) are automatically used to define the transactions output schemas. They can also be used anywhere in current project sequences, using the <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName</b> and <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The referenced WSDL file is copied locally in current project's resources, in <span class="computer">wsdl</span> folder. <br/>\
 \u2022 The imported WSDL file should declare a target namespace different from the target namespace of the current project. It is mandatory for an XSD to be imported in another.<br/>
