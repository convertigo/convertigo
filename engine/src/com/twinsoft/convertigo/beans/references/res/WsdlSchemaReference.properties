display_name=WSDL reference
short_description=A reference to a WSDL file to use in the project.
property.filepath.display_name=WSDL local path
property.filepath.short_description=Defines the Convertigo local path of the imported WSDL file. | \
 <p>If the WSDL file to import is a local file in the current project or in the current workspace, this <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used to define the local file path.</p>\
 <p>This path is relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>./</code> are relative to Convertigo workspace,</li>\
  <li><code>.//</code> are relative to current project folder.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only one of both <b>WSDL local path</b> or <b>WSDL URL</b> properties can be used. If both are filled, only <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used.</p>
property.urlpath.display_name=WSDL URL
property.urlpath.short_description=Defines the URL of the WSDL file to import. | \
 <p>If the WSDL file to import is outside of the current project (either a remote file or a file on the developer's computer but external to the project), this <b>WSDL URL</b> property is used to define the file's original URL.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>If the file to import is located in the file system (local or network drives), use the "Browse" button of the wizard: it will automatically create the correct file URL depending on your operating system (<code>file://[host]/path</code> or <code>file:[//host]/path</code>).</li>\
  <li>Once imported, the WSDL file will be copied locally in the current project's resources. This will then fill the <b>WSDL local path</b> property. If both are filled, only <b>WSDL local path</b> property is used.</li>\
 </ul>
