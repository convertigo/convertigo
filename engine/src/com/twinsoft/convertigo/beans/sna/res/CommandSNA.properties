display_name=SNA commands
short_description=Defines and handles keywords and commands found in legacy screens for <span class="computer">SNA</span>. | The <i>SNA commands</i> extraction rule detects patterns of the form <span class="computer">&lt;KeyName&gt;&lt;Separator&gt;&lt;Action&gt;</span>, where <span class="computer">KeyName</span> must be found in a list provided in the <b>Keywords table</b> property of the rule.<br/>\
The rule transforms these blocks into <span class="computer">keyword</span> type blocks and adds following XML attributes to matching blocks:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">action</span>: the javelin action to be executed on the mainframe,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">data</span>: optional additional data to be sent with the action.<br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">keyword</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">keyword</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">keyword.xsl</span> file. To change the way keywords are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.keywordSeparator.display_name=Keyword separators
property.keywordSeparator.short_description=Defines a concatenated list of keyword separator(s) that can be used. | This property lists separator characters used to separate each keyword name from its action.<br/>\
For example, "<span class="computer">=</span>" is a keyword separator that matches the <span class="computer">F3=EXIT</span> command.
property.labelLocation.display_name=Label location
property.labelLocation.short_description=Defines where to search for the label. | The label location value can be one of the following:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">From right block</span>: the label is to the right of the keyword. For example: <span class="computer">F12=Open</span><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">From left block</span>: the label is to the left of the keyword. For example: <span class="computer">Open=F12</span><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">From block above</span>: the label is on top of the keyword. For example: <span class="computer">DO This F12</span><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">From block below</span>: the label is below the keyword. For example: <span class="computer">F12 Do This</span><br/>
property.separatorMendatory.display_name=Separator mandatory
property.separatorMendatory.short_description=Defines whether a separator character between keyword and label is mandatory. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, a block containing a keyword (defined in <b>Keywords table</b> property) but which doesn't have one of the separator characters (defined in <b>Keyword separators</b> property) next to it will not match the rule.
