display_name=AS400 menu
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">AS/400</span> like menu. | The <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule handles <span class="computer">AS/400</span> and other IBM mainframe application menus, such as <span class="computer">5250</span> or <span class="computer">3270</span> screen menus. In such applications, menus have all a standard format which the <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule automatically manages.<br/>\
The rule detects in the green screen patterns such as the following: <br/><span class="computer">&lt;number&gt;&lt;separator&gt; &lt;menu item label&gt;</span><br/>\
The <span class="computer">number</span> can be any number. The <span class="computer">separator</span> is represented by one character only; it is set in the <b>Separators</b> property. The <span class="computer">menu item label</span> can be any string of characters.<br/>\
The <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule creates an XML element of <span class="computer">snamenu</span> type. This element contains the menu itself, with each line of the menu being tagged as a <span class="computer">menuitem</span> element, of <span class="computer">menuitem</span> type.<br/>\
Each <span class="computer">menuitem</span> element includes the following attributes added by the extraction rule:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">id</span>: Number identified in the original text detected as pattern (i.e. number of the menu item),<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">literal</span>: Text content of the menu item (i.e. its label).<br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> XML elements of the <span class="computer">snamenu</span> type are handled by the <span class="computer">SNA menu</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">snamenu.xsl</span> file. To change the way SNA menus are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.
property.keywordSeparator.display_name=Separators
property.keywordSeparator.short_description=Defines a concatenated list of separator characters that can be used between a menu item number and its label. | This property lists separator characters used to separate each menu item number from its label.<br/>\
For example, "<span class="computer">.</span>" is a separator that matches the <span class="computer">1. User task</span> menu item.
