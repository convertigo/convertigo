display_name=AS400 menu
short_description=Defines an <code>AS/400</code> like menu. | \
 <p>The <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule handles <code>AS/400</code> and other IBM mainframe application menus, such as <code>5250</code> or <code>3270</code> screen menus. In such applications, menus have all a standard format which the <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule automatically manages.</p>\
 <p>The rule detects in the green screen patterns such as the following:</p>\
 <code>&lt;number&gt;&lt;separator&gt; &lt;menu item label&gt;</code>\
 <p>The <code>number</code> can be any number. The <code>separator</code> is represented by one character only; it is set in the <b>Separators</b> property. The <code>menu item label</code> can be any string of characters.</p>\
 <p>The <i>AS400 menu</i> extraction rule creates an XML element of <code>snamenu</code> type. This element contains the menu itself, with each line of the menu being tagged as a <code>menuitem</code> element, of <code>menuitem</code> type.</p>\
 <p>Each <code>menuitem</code> element includes the following attributes added by the extraction rule:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>id</code>: Number identified in the original text detected as pattern (i.e. number of the menu item),</li>\
  <li><code>literal</code>: Text content of the menu item (i.e. its label).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> XML elements of the <code>snamenu</code> type are handled by the <code>SNA menu</code> XSL template described in the <code>snamenu.xsl</code> file. To change the way SNA menus are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</p>
property.keywordSeparator.display_name=Separators
property.keywordSeparator.short_description=Defines a concatenated list of separator characters that can be used between a menu item number and its label. | \
 <p>This property lists separator characters used to separate each menu item number from its label.</p>\
 <p>For example, "<code>.</code>" is a separator that matches the <code>1. User task</code> menu item.</p>
