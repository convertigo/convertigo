display_name=5250 extended objects
short_description=Automatic <code>5250</code> extended objects extraction. | \
 <p>This rule automatically detects <code>Extended TN5250 NPTUI</code> objects in mainframe legacy screens.</p>\
 <p>Unlike standard extraction rules, the <i>5250 extended objects</i> rule doens't visually identify objects in displayed screen. In fact, extended objects are well-defined structures and their presence in a screen is embedded inside the <code>TN5250</code> stream. One instance of the rule is then enough to correctly detect all NPTUI objects in the screen class.</p>\
 <p>There are various extended, or NPTUI, elements available in such an application. Usual NPTUI objects are the following:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Radio buttons</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <code>choice</code> type, which are handled by the <code>choice</code> XSL template described in the <code>choice.xsl</code> file. To change the way choices are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li><b>Checkboxes</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of the <code>checkbox</code> type, which are handled by the <code>checkbox</code> XSL template described in the <code>checkbox.xsl</code> file. To change the way checkboxes are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li><b>Windows</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of the <code>panel</code> type, which are handled by the <code>panel</code> XSL template described in the <code>panel.xsl</code> file. To change the way panels are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li><b>Continuous fields</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <code>filed</code> type, which are handled by the <code>field</code> XSL template described in the <code>field.xsl</code> file. To change the way fields are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li><b>Buttons</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <code>keyword</code> type, which are handled by the <code>keyword</code> XSL template described in the <code>keyword.xsl</code> file. To change the way keywords are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
  <li><b>Sliders</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <code>slider</code> type, which are handled by the <code>slider</code> XSL template described in the <code>slider.xsl</code> file. To change the way sliders are displayed in the HTML page, edit this file.</li>\
