display_name=5250 extended objects
short_description=Automatic <span class="computer">5250</span> extended objects extraction. | This rule automatically detects <span class="computer">Extended TN5250 NPTUI</span> objects in mainframe legacy screens. <br/>\
Unlike standard extraction rules, the <i>5250 extended objects</i> rule doens't visually identify objects in displayed screen. In fact, extended objects are well-defined structures and their presence in a screen is embedded inside the <span class="computer">TN5250</span> stream. One instance of the rule is then enough to correctly detect all NPTUI objects in the screen class.<br/>\
There are various extended, or NPTUI, elements available in such an application. Usual NPTUI objects are the following:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Radio buttons</b>: they are extracted as XML elements of <span class="computer">choice</span> type, which are handled by the <span class="computer">choice</span> XSL template described in the <span class="computer">choice.xsl</span> file.
