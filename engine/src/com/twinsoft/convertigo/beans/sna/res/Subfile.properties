display_name=Subfile
short_description=Extracts structured data from an <code>AS/400</code> like subfile. | \
 <p>The <i>Subfile</i> extraction rule extracts table data from screens for AS/400 specific subfile format. It is similar to the <i>Table</i> extraction rule, but runs automatically with no need to manually configure columns.</p>\
 <p>Subfiles are detected only if required parameters are properly set. A number of conditions must also be met for the rule to apply:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>End of the subfile zone must be indicated by an end marker string (End, +, More..., etc.),</li>\
  <li>Presentation attributes of the end marker must be different than those of the subfile content (usually white on black background),</li>\
  <li>Presentation attributes of data must be different than those of the end marker or titles (data usually displayed in green on black background),</li>\
  <li>Subfile must start with a title line,</li>\
  <li>Presentation attributes of titles must be different than those of the subfile content (usually white on black background, sometimes underlined),</li>\
  <li>Each title must be separated from the next by a minimum of 2 spaces (if the title line is made of one large field only) OR each title is in a distinct AS400 DSPV map field,</li>\
  <li>Each title is left-aligned in its column,</li>\
  <li>Actions (if any) are to be listed above the subfile,</li>\
  <li>Presentation attributes of actions (if any) must be different than those of titles (usually blue on black background),</li>\
  <li>Each action (if any) must respect the following pattern: <code>&lt;action code&gt;&lt;separator&gt;&lt;action label&gt;</code>. By default, <code>separator</code> is represented by the "=" sign. For example: <code>E=Edit</code>, <code>A=Add</code>, etc.</li>\
  <li>For actions to be detected, the first column of each non-empty line in the subfile must contain an input field.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> Actions (last four points) are optional for correct subfile detection.</p>\
 <p>As a conclusion, the subfile structure always follows the same pattern:</p>\
 <code>&lt;Actions&gt;</code> (optionnal)\
 <code>&lt;Title line&gt;</code>\
 <code>&lt;Subfile content&gt;</code>\
 <code>&lt;End marker&gt;</code>\
 <p>This order cannot be changed, and no other data can be inserted in the 5250 screen zone of the subfile.</p>
property.endString.display_name=Subfile end marker strings
property.endString.short_description=Defines the list of strings that can be used to detect the end of the subfile. | \
 <p>This string must be located according to the CUA spec (below last subfile row, to the far right) and be provided as a comma separated list of marker strings. Make sure that all of them are set, including in any language. For example: <code>A suivre...,Fin,+,Bottom,End,More...</code></p>
property.titleRowAttribute.display_name=Title row attributes
property.titleRowAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the title row of the subfile. | \
 <p>Make sure that attributes are described so that all title lines match. For example, the <b>underline</b> parameter of this property can be set to "<code>don't care</code>" to match the normal and underline titles.</p>\
 <p>Presentation attributes to configure are :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Color</b>: <code>Foreground</code> color, <code>Background</code> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".</li>\
  <li><b>Decoration</b>: <code>bold</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>underlined</code>, <code>blink</code>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".</li>\
 </ul>
property.actionLineAttribute.display_name=Actions line attributes 
property.actionLineAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the actions of the subfile (if existing). | \
 <p>Presentation attributes to configure are :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Color</b>: <code>Foreground</code> color, <code>Background</code> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".</li>\
  <li><b>Decoration</b>: <code>bold</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>underlined</code>, <code>blink</code>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".</li>\
 </ul>
property.endStringAttribute.display_name=End marker string attributes
property.endStringAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the end marker string. | \
 <p>Presentation attributes to configure are :</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Color</b>: <code>Foreground</code> color, <code>Background</code> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".</li>\
  <li><b>Decoration</b>: <code>bold</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>underlined</code>, <code>blink</code>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".</li>\
 </ul>
property.autoValidate.display_name=Auto-validate
property.autoValidate.short_description=Auto validates action triggered after an option has been chosen in the selection column. | \
 <p>If this property is set to <code>true</code>, the action will be automatically and immediately executed after a user has clicked on an option of the webized contextual action menu. Usually set to <code>false</code> to enable users to click options on several lines before validating by <code>ENTER</code>.</p>
property.removeActionLines.display_name=Remove actions line
property.removeActionLines.short_description=Defines whether to remove actions line or not from webized screen (leaving the actions as a popup when clicking a row in the table). | \
 <p>If set to <code>true</code>, the actions line is removed from the webized screen and shown in selection fields contextual menu only.</p>
property.keepEmptyLines.display_name=Keep empty lines
property.keepEmptyLines.short_description=Defines whether to keep empty lines from the table. | \
 <p>Empty table lines are removed by default (property set to <code>false</code>. Set this property to <code>true</code> to keep them.</p>
property.subFileDetectionStartLine.display_name=Start detection from line
property.subFileDetectionStartLine.short_description=Detects subfile from specified line. | \
 <p>The end marker string is detected by default anywhere on the screen. You can specify the line where this detection should start. Useful to ignore subfile markers that could be present in the subfile data.</p>
