display_name=Subfile
short_description=Extracts structured data from an <span class="computer">AS/400</span> like subfile. | The <i>Subfile</i> extraction rule extracts table data from screens for AS/400 specific subfile format. It is similar to the <i>Table</i> extraction rule, but runs automatically with no need to manually configure columns.<br/>\
Subfiles are detected only if required parameters are properly set. A number of conditions must also be met for the rule to apply:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 End of the subfile zone must be indicated by an end marker string (End, +, More..., etc.), <br/>\
 \u2022 Presentation attributes of the end marker must be different than those of the subfile content (usually white on black background), <br/>\
 \u2022 Presentation attributes of data must be different than those of the end marker or titles (data usually displayed in green on black background), <br/>\
 \u2022 Subfile must start with a title line, <br/>\
 \u2022 Presentation attributes of titles must be different than those of the subfile content (usually white on black background, sometimes underlined), <br/>\
 \u2022 Each title must be separated from the next by a minimum of 2 spaces (if the title line is made of one large field only) OR each title is in a distinct AS400 DSPV map field, <br/>\
 \u2022 Each title is left-aligned in its column, <br/>\
 \u2022 Actions (if any) are to be listed above the subfile, <br/>\
 \u2022 Presentation attributes of actions (if any) must be different than those of titles (usually blue on black background), <br/>\
 \u2022 Each action (if any) must respect the following pattern: <span class="computer">&lt;action code&gt;&lt;separator&gt;&lt;action label&gt;</span>. By default, <span class="computer">separator</span> is represented by the "=" sign. For example: <span class="computer">E=Edit</span>, <span class="computer">A=Add</span>, etc.<br/>\
 \u2022 For actions to be detected, the first column of each non-empty line in the subfile must contain an input field.<br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Actions (last four points) are optional for correct subfile detection.<br/>\
As a conclusion, the subfile structure always follows the same pattern: <br/>\
<span class="computer">&lt;Actions&gt;</span> (optionnal)<br/>\
<span class="computer">&lt;Title line&gt;</span><br/>\
<span class="computer">&lt;Subfile content&gt;</span><br/>\
<span class="computer">&lt;End marker&gt;</span><br/>\
This order cannot be changed, and no other data can be inserted in the 5250 screen zone of the subfile.
property.endString.display_name=Subfile end marker strings
property.endString.short_description=Defines the list of strings that can be used to detect the end of the subfile. | This string must be located according to the CUA spec (below last subfile row, to the far right) and be provided as a comma separated list of marker strings. Make sure that all of them are set, including in any language. For example: <span class="computer">A suivre...,Fin,+,Bottom,End,More...</span>
property.titleRowAttribute.display_name=Title row attributes
property.titleRowAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the title row of the subfile. | Make sure that attributes are described so that all title lines match. For example, the <b>underline</b> parameter of this property can be set to "<span class="computer">don't care</span>" to match the normal and underline titles.<br/>\
Presentation attributes to configure are :\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022  <b>Color</b>: <span class="computer">Foreground</span> color, <span class="computer">Background</span> color, to choose in a list of predefined colors or "not to take into account".<br/>\
 \u2022  <b>Decoration</b>: <span class="computer">bold</span>, <span class="computer">reverse</span>, <span class="computer">underlined</span>, <span class="computer">blink</span>, for each decoration choose between "with the decoration", "normal" (i.e. without the decoration), or "not to take into account".<br/>
property.actionLineAttribute.display_name=Actions line attributes 
property.actionLineAttribute.short_description=Defines the attributes of the actions of the subfile (if existing). | <br/>\
Presentation attributes to configure are :\

property.autoValidate.display_name=Auto-validate
property.autoValidate.short_description=Auto validates action triggered after an option has been chosen in the selection column. | If this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the action will be automatically and immediately executed after a user has clicked on an option of the webized contextual action menu. Usually set to <span class="computer">false</span> to enable users to click options on several lines before validating by <span class="computer">ENTER</span>.
property.removeActionLines.display_name=Remove actions line
property.removeActionLines.short_description=Defines whether to remove actions line or not from webized screen (leaving the actions as a popup when clicking a row in the table). | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the actions line is removed from the webized screen and shown in selection fields contextual menu only.
property.keepEmptyLines.display_name=Keep empty lines
property.keepEmptyLines.short_description=Defines whether to keep empty lines from the table. | Empty table lines are removed by default (property set to <span class="computer">false</span>. Set this property to <span class="computer">true</span> to keep them.
property.subFileDetectionStartLine.display_name=Start detection from line
property.subFileDetectionStartLine.short_description=Detects subfile from specified line. | The end marker string is detected by default anywhere on the screen. You can specify the line where this detection should start. Useful to ignore subfile markers that could be present in the subfile data.
