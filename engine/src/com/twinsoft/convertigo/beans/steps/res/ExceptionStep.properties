display_name=jException
short_description=Raises a Convertigo Engine exception. | \
 <p>In some circumstances, it is necessary to explicitly raise a Convertigo Engine exception. This is reflected as a <code>SoapFaultException</code> for SOAP web service callers or by an error structure in XML output for any other caller.</p>\
 <p><b>Message</b> and <b>Details</b> properties can be set to complex JavaScript expressions, mixing text strings and data from variables. These expressions are evaluated during the sequence execution and build a dynamic message and details output in the raised exception.</p>\
 <p>The error XML structure contains a <code>type</code> attribute, which value is automatically set to <code>c8o</code> in case of Exception. It allows to differentiate an irrecoverable Server error from a project/applicative error created using an <i>Error</i> step (<code>type</code> attribute value is then <code>project</code>).</p>\
 <p>A <i>jException</i> step breaks the sequence execution flow, the sequence ends just after this step's execution (contrary to <i>Error</i> step which does not break the execution flow).</p>
property.message.display_name=Message
property.message.short_description=Provides the (humanly readable) error message. | \
 <p>This property allows the developer to dynamically define the message text of the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.</p>
property.details.display_name=Details
property.details.short_description=Provides additional details about the triggered error. | \
 <p>This property allows the developer to dynamically add some details content in the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.</p>
