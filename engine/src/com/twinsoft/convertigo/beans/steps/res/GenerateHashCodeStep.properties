display_name=Hash code
short_description=Generates a hash code from a given file. | The <i>Hash code</i> step generates a hash code from a given file using a predefined algorithm, that can be configured using the <b>Hash algorithm</b> property.
property.nodeName.display_name=Node name
property.nodeName.short_description=Defines the tag name of the generated XML element. | This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters, <br/>\
 \u2022 it cannot start with a number, <br/>\
 \u2022 it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.<br/>
property.sourcePath.display_name=Source
property.sourcePath.short_description=Defines the path of the file to hash. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file to hash. <br/>\
This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. <br/>
property.hashAlgorithm.display_name=Hash algorithm
property.hashAlgorithm.short_description=Defines the algorithm to use for file hashing. | This property can take one of the following values:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">MD5</span>: uses <span class="computer">MD5</span> algorithm to generate the hash from the file, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">SHA-1</span>: uses <span class="computer">SHA-1</span> algorithm to generate the hash from the file.<br/>
property.offset.display_name=Offset
property.offset.short_description=Defines the offset in bytes from where the hash starts. | This property allows you to hash just a part of your file. The offset must not be bigger than the file size.
