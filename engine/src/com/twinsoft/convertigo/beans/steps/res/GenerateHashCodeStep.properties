display_name=Hash code
short_description=Generates a hash code from a given file. | \
 <p>The <i>Hash code</i> step generates a hash code from a given file using a predefined algorithm, that can be configured using the <b>Hash algorithm</b> property.</p>
property.nodeName.display_name=Node name
property.nodeName.short_description=Defines the tag name of the generated XML element. | \
 <p>This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters,</li>\
  <li>it cannot start with a number,</li>\
  <li>it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.</li>\
 </ul>
property.sourcePath.display_name=Source
property.sourcePath.short_description=Defines the path of the file to hash. | \
 <p>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file to hash.</p>\
 <p>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>./</code> are relative to Convertigo workspace,</li>\
  <li><code>.//</code> are relative to current project folder.</li>\
 </ul>
property.hashAlgorithm.display_name=Hash algorithm
property.hashAlgorithm.short_description=Defines the algorithm to use for file hashing. | \
 <p>This property can take one of the following values:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>MD5</code>: uses <code>MD5</code> algorithm to generate the hash from the file,</li>\
  <li><code>SHA-1</code>: uses <code>SHA-1</code> algorithm to generate the hash from the file.</li>\
 </ul>
property.offset.display_name=Offset
property.offset.short_description=Defines the offset in bytes from where the hash starts. | \
 <p>This property allows you to hash just a part of your file. The offset must not be bigger than the file size.</p>
