display_name=Get request header
short_description=Gets value of a request header for the current sequence. | \
 <p>The <i>Get request header</i> step allows to retrieve a given HTTP header for the current sequence's request.</p>\
 <p>The header name is set using the <b>Header name</b> property.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although its <b>Output</b> property is set to <code>false</code> by default, this step generates an <code>header</code> XML Element in output, that contain the header name and value in child elements.</p>
property.headerName.display_name=Header name
property.headerName.short_description=Defines the header's name. | \
 <p>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the name of the header to retrieve from the request.</p>\
 <p>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a default text value,</li>\
  <li>a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,</li>\
  <li>a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</li>\
 </ul>
