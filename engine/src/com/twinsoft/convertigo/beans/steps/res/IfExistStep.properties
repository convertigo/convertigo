display_name=IfExist
short_description=Defines an <span class="computer">IF</span> conditional step looking for node(s) on a source. | The <i>IfExist</i> step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step contains other steps executed only if the source defined through the <b>Source</b> property exists. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfExist</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfExistThenElse</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>IfExistThenElse</b>. The <b>Source</b> property remains the same and the steps present in the <i>IfExist</i> are moved to the <i>Then</i> sub-step.
