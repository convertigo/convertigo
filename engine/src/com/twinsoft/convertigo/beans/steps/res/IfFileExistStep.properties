display_name=IfFileExists
short_description=Defines an <code>IF</code> conditional step looking for the existence of a file or a directory. | \
 <p>The <i>IfFileExists</i> step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step contains other steps executed only if the file or directory defined through the <b>Source</b> property exists.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfFileExists</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfFileExistsThenElse</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>IfFileExistsThenElse</b>. The <b>Source</b> property remains the same and the steps present in the <i>IfFileExists</i> are moved to the <i>Then</i> sub-step.</p>
property.condition.display_name=Source
property.condition.short_description=Defines the path of the file or directory which existence has to be checked. | \
 <p>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file or directory which existence has to be checked.</p>\
 <p>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>./</code> are relative to Convertigo workspace,</li>\
  <li><code>.//</code> are relative to current project folder.</li>\
 </ul>
