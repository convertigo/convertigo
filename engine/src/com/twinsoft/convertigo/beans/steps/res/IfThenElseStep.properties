display_name=jIfThenElse
short_description=Defines an <code>IF...THEN...ELSE...</code> conditional step based on a JavaScript condition. | \
 <p>The <i>jIfThenElse</i> step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>Then</code> step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified,</li>\
  <li><code>Else</code> step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>The condition, defined in the <b>Condition</b> property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>jIfThenElse</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>jIf</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>jIf</b>. The <b>Condition</b> property remains the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>steps present in the <i>Then</i> step are moved to the <i>jIf</i>,</li>\
  <li>steps present in the <i>Else</i> step are deleted.</li>\
 </ul>
