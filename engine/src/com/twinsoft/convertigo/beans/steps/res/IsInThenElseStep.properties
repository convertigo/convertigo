display_name=IfIsInThenElse
short_description=Defines an <code>IF...THEN...ELSE...</code> conditional step looking for matches on a source. | \
 <p>The <i>IfIsInThenElse</i> step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a source and one or more regular expression(s) called "Tests". This step contains two child steps (<i>Then</i> and <i>Else</i>) which are executed depending on whether the specified source exists and if tests match on that specified source or not:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><i>Then</i> step and child steps are executed when specified source exists and tests match on source,</li>\
  <li><i>Else</i> step and child steps are executed when specified source exists and tests do not match on source or when specified source does not exist.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>IfIsInThenElse</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>IfIsIn</i>, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>IfIsIn</b>. The <b>Source</b> and <b>Tests</b> properties remain the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>steps present in the <i>Then</i> step are moved to the <i>IfIsIn</i>,</li>\
  <li>steps present in the <i>Else</i> step are deleted.</li>\
 </ul>
