display_name=Iterator
short_description=Defines a loop step iterating on XML nodes result from a source. | \
 <p>Also called <i>For Each</i> step, the <i>Iterator</i> step:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>defines a source as input list to work on, i.e. a list of nodes from a previous step, used as a recurring element (for example table rows),</li>\
  <li>iterates on each element of the specified source,</li>\
  <li>contains child steps that are executed on each iteration, as other loop steps (for example, see "<i>jIterator</i>", "<i>jWhile</i>" and "<i>jDoWhile</i>" steps documentation and examples).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>In the iteration, child steps can access and use the current iterated element:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>using a source pointing on the <i>Iterator</i> step itself,</li>\
  <li>using the JavaScript variable named <code>item</code>, which is a Java Node object (item of the NodeList resulting from the input source).</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>They also can access the current iteration index using the JavaScript variable named <code>index</code> updated on each iteration, which is an integer.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> The current item value can be accessed using the following code statement:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><code>item.getTextContent()</code> if the Node is of Text or Attribute type,</li>\
  <li><code>item.getNodeValue()</code> if the Node is of Element type.</li>\
 </ul>
property.condition.display_name=Stopping index
property.condition.short_description=Defines the exclusive index to which the <i>Iterator</i> should stop to iterate. | \
 <p>Intended mostly for testing purposes, this (optional) parameter limits the number of times the iterator loops if this last index is reached.</p>\
 <p>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution. By default, it is not filled, so the <i>Iterator</i> loops on each node from the source.</p>
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source list to iterate on. | \
 <p>This property allows defining a list of nodes from a previous step on which current step works.</p>\
 <p>A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</p>\
 <p>If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step has no data to work on: the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues.</p>
property.startIndex.display_name=Starting index
property.startIndex.short_description=Defines the index from which the <i>Iterator</i> should start to iterate. | \
 <p>In the case you do not want to start an iteration at the first item (index <code>0</code>), you can specify a starting index in this property.</p>\
 <p>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution. By default, it is set to <code>0</code> for starting at the first item of the source list.</p>\
 <p>If the defined starting index does not exist in the source list, the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues.</p>
