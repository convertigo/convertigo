display_name=Array
short_description=Creates an XML element ready to output a JSON Array. | \
 <p>The <i>Array</i> step adds an element node ready to output a JSON Array.</p>\
 <p>The element resulting from this step can be output in the response of the sequence if the <b>Output</b> property is set to <code>true</code>, or used as a source by any other following step.</p>\
 <p><i>Array</i> will be inserted to its <i>Object</i> parent using the <b>key</b> property as JSON key. Its value is set thanks to a source defined in <b>Source</b> property. If no source is defined or if its results is empty, the XML element contains the value of the <b>Default value</b> property, if a value is defined in this property.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Other JSON Child steps can be added under this step to create a data structure.</li>\
 </ul>
property.key.display_name=Key
property.key.short_description=Defines the key name used for its Object parent owner. | \
 <p>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key.</p>\
 <p>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a hard-coded text value,</li>\
  <li>a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,</li>\
  <li>a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>If you use the <b>source</b> type for this property, the XPath application on target should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.</li>\
 </ul>
