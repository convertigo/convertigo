display_name=JSON to XML
short_description=Creates an XML attribute node based on a JavaScript expression. | The <i>JSON to XML</i> step adds an typed XML structure node to the parent generated XML element in the sequence XML output. <br/>\
The resulting from this step can be output in the response XML of the sequence if the <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, or used as a source by any other following step. <br/>
property.key.display_name=Key
property.key.short_description=Defines the key name used for its Object parent owner. | This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key. <br/>\
A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a hard-coded text value, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 If you use the <b>source</b> type for this property, the XPath application on target XML should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.
property.jsonObject.display_name=JSON Object
property.jsonObject.short_description=Defines an object from the JS scope or parse a JSON String that will be transformed to an XML typed structure. | This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key. <br/>\
A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types: \
<br/><br/>\

property.jsonSample.display_name=JSON Sample
property.jsonSample.short_description=Defines a sample of the expected JSON, used to extract the schema of the response.
property.arrayChildrenTag.display_name=Array children TagName
property.arrayChildrenTag.short_description=Defines TagName used to describe elements under a JSON array.
