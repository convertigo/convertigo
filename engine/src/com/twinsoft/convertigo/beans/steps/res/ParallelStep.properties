display_name=Parallel
short_description=Defines a step executing child steps in parallel. | \
 <p>A <i>Parallel</i> step executes steps simultaneously in parallel contexts. The maximum number of contexts is set by the value of the <b>Max. threads</b> property.</p>\
 <p>Each child step is executed in a dedicated thread. When a child thread is completed, all of its resources are released. As a consequence, a step defined outside a <i>Parallel</i> step cannot source any information from it.</p>\
 <p>To do so, it is recommended that you:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>create a <i>Complex</i> step as a parent of the <i>Parallel</i> step,</li>\
  <li>generate information from the <i>Parallel</i> step into the <i>Complex</i> step,</li>\
  <li>use the <i>Complex</i> step as a source outside the <i>Parallel</i> step.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>A <i>Parallel</i> step is completed (i.e. the sequence will continue flow execution) when all child threads have been completed. This means the step following a <i>Parallel</i> step starts right after all child threads have been completed.</p>\
 <p>Convertigo contexts are created for each child step executed in parallel. These contexts are automatically named after parent <i>Parallel</i> step properties.</p>\
 <p>If <i>Call transaction</i> or <i>Call sequence</i> steps are child of a <i>Parallel</i> step, contexts can be named after their <b>Context</b> property or automatically if this property is not specified.</p>\
 <p>Every automatically named context will be deleted after the <i>Parallel</i> step execution is completed. Explicitly named contexts will remain for further transaction or sequence use.</p>
