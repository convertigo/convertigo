The template file path can be either relative or absolute : <br/>\ \u2022 ./ are relative to Convertigo workspace. <br/>\ \u2022 .// are relative to current project folder. <br/>\ \u2022  For absolute path you need to escape "\\". <br/>\  Two actions are possible : <i>fillForm</i> and <i>getFields</i>. <br/>\ For the <b><i>Fields</i></b> property you can source your fields created with a complex type, or use a JSON array type expression. <br/>\ If using a JSON array type expression, this must be of the type : {key: value} where 'key' is your field name and 'value' its value. <br/>\
<br />If you want to insert images in the PDF. You must create in the template for each image placeholder a "Submit" Button field with the size and position you would like the image to be inserted. \
The Form Fill Step will automatically scale the image to the Size of the button.<br /> \
