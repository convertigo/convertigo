short_description=<i>Generate a PDF with dynamic data in it.</i> | The <i><b>PDF form step</b></i> allows you to generate a PDF. You can use a tool such as <a href="https://www.pdfescape.com/open/?expired" target="_blank">PDFescape</a> to make your PDF dynamic. You can use a complex containing elements to add dynamic values in your PDF. The elements names must be the name of your fields, then add its values. <br/>\
The template file path can be either relative or absolute : <br/>\ \u2022 ./ are relative to Convertigo workspace. <br/>\ \u2022 .// are relative to current project folder. <br/>\ \u2022  For absolute path you need to escape "\\". <br/>\  Two actions are possible : <i>fillForm</i> and <i>getFields</i>. <br/>\ For the <b><i>Fields</i></b> property you can source your fields created with a complex type, or use a JSON Object type expression. <br/>\ If using a JSON Object type expression, this must be of the type : {key: value} where 'key' is your field name and 'value' its value. <br/>\
<br />If you want to insert images in the PDF. You must create in the template for each image placeholder a "Submit" Button field with the size and position you would like the image to be inserted. \
The Form Fill Step will automatically scale the image to the Size of the button.<br /> \
The Image data can be in base64 format (Without the data:image/xxxx;base64, header) or can be a JPG or GIF file on disk. In this case just give the path to the image file. \ <br /><u><b>Action :</b></u> <br/>\ \u2022 <i>fillForm :</i> Fill the form fields with values. You can use either complex type with elements or JSON Object type expression. <br/>\ \u2022 <i>getFields :</i> Collect all the fields of your PDF template. Return a XML schema.
