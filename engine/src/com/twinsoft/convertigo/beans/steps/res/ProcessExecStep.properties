display_name=Process execute
short_description=Defines a step able to execute a process. |  A <i>Process execute</i> step executes the string command specified by the <b>Command line</b> property in a separate subprocess. <br/>\
The subprocess environment parameters and working directory may be defined through the <b>Environment parameters</b> and <b>Execution directory</b> properties. If left empty, they're inherited from the current process. <br/>\
Depending on the value of the <b>Wait for end</b> property, the step will wait or not until the subprocess has terminated.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Only real programs can be executed thanks to this step. In other words, you cannot execute commands interpreted by a shell (Windows DOS or Linux Bash for example).
property.commandLine.display_name=Command line
property.commandLine.short_description=Defines the process command line. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution. JavaScript variables and code are supported in this property. <br/>\
The syntax of this command line depends on the operating system where Convertigo is installed. If you want to execute some bash command use the ["bash", "-c", "my bash command"]. If you have a complex command to execute \
use the array syntax and separated each part of the command in a string array.
property.executionDirectory.display_name=Execution directory
property.executionDirectory.short_description=Defines the process execution directory. | If left empty, execution directory is inherited from the current process, Convertigo. <br/>\
For a project running in Convertigo Studio, the default directory is the installation directory (were is found the <span class="computer">ConvertigoStudio.exe</span> file). \
For a project running in Convertigo Server, the default directory is the application server root folder (tomcat folder for a standard Server installation on Windows).
property.envParameters.display_name=Environment parameters
property.envParameters.short_description=Defines the process environment parameters. | This property allows to define a list of environment parameters to define for the process execution. For each environment parameter, two columns have to be set: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Variable</b>: defines the name of the parameter, <br/>\
 \u2022 <b>Value</b>: defines the value of the parameter. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 A new environment parameter can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The environment parameters defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon. <br/><br/>\
 \u2022 If left empty, environment parameters are inherited from the current process, Convertigo. <br/>
property.waitForProcessEnd.display_name=Wait for end
property.waitForProcessEnd.short_description=Specifies whether the sequence should wait for the end of the process before continuing with next step. | Default value is <span class="computer">true</span>, so the following step in the parent sequence is executed only after the process execution has returned.
property.commandCharset.display_name=Encoding
property.commandCharset.short_description=Defines the encoding used for the process output. | Default value is <span class="computer">UTF-8</span>. If value is left empty, the default encoding of the Java virtual machine is used.
