display_name=Push Notifications
short_description=[Deprecated] Defines a step able to send notifications to mobile devices. | The <i>Push Notifications</i> step is used to make the sequence send a notification to mobile devices using one of the standard <span class="computer">APNS</span> (Apple), or <span class="computer">GCM</span> (Android) channels. <br/>\
The list of devices to which send the notification is configured using the <b>Device tokens</b> property. The data to be sent in the notification is configured using the <b>Notification data</b> property. <br/>\
Other properties (which names start by APNS or Google) are those to use in order to configure the technical parameters of the push system. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> For more information about using Push notifications in Convertigo, please refer to the article in our technical blog: http://www.convertigo.com/en/how-to/technical-blog/entry/using-convertigo-push-manager.html
property.token.display_name=Device tokens
property.token.short_description=Defines the list of tokens identifying the mobile devices to notify. | The <b>Device tokens</b> property is of source type, defining a list of nodes from a previous step for current step to work on. <br/>\
A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step has no data to work on: no device is selected, no notification is sent, and the parent sequence execution continues. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 The mobile device tokens must be known from the Convertigo Server so a list of tokens can be used in this property. Generally, the tokens are generated by the mobile device itself and are sent to Convertigo Server by executing a "storing" sequence. The "storing" sequence should store the tokens in a database (or else), so that they can be retrieved and used in this property. <br/>\
 \u2022 The mobile device tokens are destination aware: an Android Google Cloud Messaging token will start by <span class="computer">gcm:</span> and Apple's APNS tokens will start by <span class="computer">apns:</span>. The tokens stored server-side already contain this piece of information. <br/>
property.clientcertificate.display_name=APNS client certificate
property.clientcertificate.short_description=Defines an Apple .p12 certificate file to use for push on iOS devices. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of a <span class="computer">.p12</span> certificate file. The <span class="computer">.p12</span> file must be generated by Apple's Certificate portal (https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action). \
This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Do not put the .p12 certificate in the <span class="computer">DisplayObject</span> folder of the current Convertigo project as it will be packaged within the mobile application during the build process. This would lead to a security breach.
property.certificatepassword.display_name=APNS certificate password
property.certificatepassword.short_description=Defines the password of the Apple .p12 certificate file. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the valid password for the <span class="computer">.p12</span> certificate file.
property.gcmapikey.display_name=Google API key
property.gcmapikey.short_description=Defines the Google Cloud messaging API key to use for push on Android devices. |  This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the Google Cloud messaging API key. This key can be obtained by following the Google Cloud Messaging documentation (http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/gs.html). 
property.apnsnotificationtype.display_name=APNS notification type
property.apnsnotificationtype.short_description=Defines the type of push notification for Apple's APNS. | This property allows to define which Apple's APNS push type is to be used. It can take one of the following values: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">Message</span>: sends messages, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">Badge</span>: notifies application's badge, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">Sound</span>: plays a sound. <br/>\
<br/>\
Default value is <span class="computer">Message</span>.
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Notification data
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the data to be sent in the notification. |  The <b>Notification data</b> property is of source type, defining a list of nodes from a previous step for current step to work on. <br/>\
A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step has no data to work on: notification is sent with no data. <br/>\
This content can be a text message, a number to be displayed on a badge, or the name of a sound to play, depending on the <b>APNS notification type</b> property value (only for iOS devices).
property.notificationTitle.display_name=Notification title
property.notificationTitle.short_description=Notification title
property.androidTimeToLive.display_name=Android push time to live
property.androidTimeToLive.short_description=Defines the time to live (in seconds) of the push notification for Android devices. | The <b>Android push time to live</b> property allows to define the time to live of the message sent for Android GCM. If the message is not delivered within this time, it will be discarded. <br/>\
This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the time to live in seconds (it should be an integer value). <br/>\
Default value is <span class="computer">3600</span> seconds, i.e. one hour. 
property.useProductionAPNS.display_name=APNS use production server
property.useProductionAPNS.short_description=Defines the usage of the APNS production (true) or development (false) server. | This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and should be a 'true' value for use the production APNS server, else use the development one.
