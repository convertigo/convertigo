display_name=Read JSON
short_description=Reads a JSON file content and loads it into the step's XML. | \
 <p>The <i>Read JSON</i> step reads any JSON file and loads its content. As a consequence, the content of the JSON file is available as a source for other following steps.</p>
property.key.display_name=Key
property.key.short_description=Defines the key name used for its Object parent owner. | \
 <p>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key.</p>\
 <p>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a hard-coded text value,</li>\
  <li>a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,</li>\
  <li>a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>If you use the <b>source</b> type for this property, the XPath application on target XML should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.</li>\
 </ul>
