short_description=Removes the authenticated user ID from the context/session. | The <i>Remove authenticated user</i> step allows to remove the authenticated user ID from the context/session. The context/session is not authenticated anymore. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Although its <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">false</span> by default, this step generates an <span class="computer">authenticatedUserID</span> XML Element in output, that should always be empty if the step succeeds.
