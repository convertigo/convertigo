display_name=Call Sequence
short_description=Defines a step invoking a sequence. | The <i>Call Sequence</i> step enables to call any existing sequence from the same project or another. It provides input variables to the target sequence, and returns XML data from the call.<br/>\
Variables to be used for the call must be described at step level by adding <i>Variables</i> child objects. You can manually set variables or use the <b>Import variables from the target sequence</b> contextual menu to automatically copy the variable definitions from the target sequence.<br/>\
The target sequence returns structured XML data, its XML schema has to be generated while developing the sequence and is automatically imported to the <i>Call Sequence</i> step while configuring its <b>Sequence</b> property. Thus, the sequence's schema is known by the calling step and elements from the sequence result can be correctly sourced from it.<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 A <i>Call Sequence</i> step with all its properties filled and including the target variables can be easily created at once in the Convertigo Studio <b>Projects</b> view. To do so, drag-and-drop with <span class="computer">Ctrl</span> key pressed a sequence from its parent project to a sequence or a block step where the <i>Call Sequence</i> step has to be created.<br/>\
 \u2022 The client/server HTTP session of parent sequence is spread to the called sequence context, even if it is called internally (<b>Internal invoke</b> property set to <span class="computer">true</span>).<br/>
property.sourceSequence.display_name=Sequence
property.sourceSequence.short_description=Defines the target project and sequence to request from this project. | The target sequence must be one of the sequences from an existing project, the project in which the <i>Call Sequence</i> step is added or another project opened in the same Convertigo. <br/>\
This property is set by selecting the target sequence in a list of values of the following form: <span class="computer">&lt;project_name&gt;.&lt;sequence_name&gt;</span> to avoid mistakes in case of sequences with the same name in several projects.
property.inheritTransactionCtx.display_name=Inherit context
property.inheritTransactionCtx.short_description=Defines whether the context used by the current sequence for transaction's steps should also be used by the target sequence. | Sequences are executing all child transactions (transactions called thanks to <i>Call transaction</i> steps) in a context automatically created (except for transactions called thanks to a <i>Call transaction</i> step with <b>Context</b> property set). For other child transactions, the automatically created context can be passed to a child sequence (called thanks to a <i>Call Sequence</i> step) for it to re-use this context for executing its child transactions. To do so, set this property to <span class="computer">true</span>.
