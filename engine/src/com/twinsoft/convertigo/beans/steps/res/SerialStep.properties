display_name=Serial
short_description=Defines a step executing child steps in series. | All child steps of a <i>Serial</i> step are executed one after another, it is similar to the basic behavior of step execution when they are positioned just under the parent <i>Generic Sequence</i>.<br/>\
A <i>Serial</i> step is completed (i.e. the sequence will continue flow execution) when all child steps have been completed. This means the step following a <i>Serial</i> step starts right after the last child step is completed.
