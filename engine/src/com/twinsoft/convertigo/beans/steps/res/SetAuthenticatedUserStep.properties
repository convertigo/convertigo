display_name=Set authenticated user
short_description=Sets a user ID as the authenticated user ID of the current context/session. | The <i>Set authenticated user</i> step allows to set a user ID as the authenticated user ID in the current context/session and thereby, sets the current context/session as authenticated. <br/>\
The user ID is set using the <b>User ID</b> property. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Although its <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">false</span> by default, this step generates an <span class="computer">authenticatedUserID</span> XML Element in output, that should always contain the user ID value if the step succeeds. 
property.userid.display_name=User ID
property.userid.short_description=Defines the user ID that has to be set as authenticated user. | This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the user ID to set in authentication. <br/>\
A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>text</b>: the value is therefore a default text value, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>JavaScript expression</b>: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution, <br/>\
 \u2022 a <b>source</b>: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> If you use the <b>source</b> type for this property, the XPath application on target XML should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.
