display_name=jSource
short_description=Defines a step extracting a list of nodes from a source into a variable in JavaScript scope. | \
 <p>The <i>jSource</i> step gets a list of nodes from the source defined in the <b>Source</b> property and sets a JavaScript variable in the current executed sequence JavaScript scope. This variable contains a <code>Java NodeList</code> object, i.e. a list of XML nodes get from the source.</p>\
 <p>The variable is named after the <b>Variable name</b> property value. It exists while the sequence is running.</p>\
 <p>If only one node matches, the variable is also a <code>NodeList</code> containing only one <code>Node</code> (index is 0). If no node matches, the variable is finally an empty <code>NodeList</code>, containing no <code>Node</code> (<code>var_name.getLength() = 0</code>).</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>The variable contains a list of node elements get from a previously executed step. To access one (<code>Node</code>) of the list, use the following syntax in a step: <code>var_name.item(index)</code>.</li>\
  <li>To access one element's text content (<code>String</code>), use the <code>element.getTextContent()</code> method, to retrieve the text of the element, or the <code>element.getNodeValue()</code> method, which result depends on the node type (will extract a text only if the <code>Node</code> is of <code>Text</code> or <code>Attribute</code> type).</li>\
 </ul>
property.variableName.display_name=Variable name
property.variableName.short_description=Defines the name of the JavaScript variable. | \
 <p>If this variable exists in scope, its value is overridden. If the variable doesn't exist in scope, it is created.</p>
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source to extract. | \
 <p>This property allows defining a list of nodes from a previous step that are set in a JavaScript variable, as described in the main description of this step.</p>\
 <p>A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</p>\
 <p>If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, depending on the step, the variable is created:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>as an empty <code>NodeList</code> with no data (for <i>jSource</i> step),</li>\
  <li><code>null</code> (for <i>jSimpleSource</i> step).</li>\
 </ul>
