 <p>This property allows defining a list of nodes from a previous step on which current step performs tests.</p>\
 <p>A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</p>\
 <p>If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step has no data to work on: the test fails.</p>
