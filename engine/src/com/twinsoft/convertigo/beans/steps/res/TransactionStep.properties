display_name=Call Transaction
short_description=Defines a step invoking a transaction. | \
 <p>The <i>Call Transaction</i> step enables to call any existing transaction from the same project or another. It provides input variables to the target transaction, and returns XML data from the call.</p>\
 <p>Variables to be used for the call must be described at step level by adding <i>Variables</i> child objects. You can manually set variables or use the <b>Import variables from the target transaction</b> contextual menu to automatically copy the variable definitions from the target transaction.</p>\
 <p>The target transaction returns structured XML data, its XML schema has to be generated while developing the transaction and is automatically imported to the <i>Call Transaction</i> step while configuring its <b>Transaction</b> property. Thus, the transaction's schema is known by the calling step and elements from the transaction result can be correctly sourced from it.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>A <i>Call Transaction</i> step with all its properties filled and including the target variables can be easily created at once in the Convertigo Studio <b>Projects</b> view. To do so, drag-and-drop with <code>Ctrl</code> key pressed a transaction from its parent connector to a sequence or a block step where the <i>Call Transaction</i> step has to be created.</li>\
  <li>The client/server HTTP session of parent sequence is spread to the called transaction context, even if it is called internally (<b>Internal invoke</b> property set to <code>true</code>).</li>\
 </ul>
property.sourceTransaction.display_name=Transaction
property.sourceTransaction.short_description=Defines the target project, connector from this project and transaction to request. | \
 <p>The target transaction must be one of the transactions of one of the connectors from an existing project, the project in which the <i>Call Sequence</i> step is added or another project opened in the same Convertigo.</p>\
 <p>This property is set by selecting the target transaction in a list of values of the following form: <code>&lt;project_name&gt;.&lt;connector_name&gt;.&lt;transaction_name&gt;</code> to avoid mistakes in case of transactions with the same name in several projects.</p>
property.connectionStringDefinition.display_name=Connection string
property.connectionStringDefinition.short_description=Replaces the connection parameters of target connector. | \
 <p>The connection string represents different data depending on connector type:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><i>HTTP / HTML connector</i>: replaces the connector URL string made up of the connector's <b>Server</b> name, server <b>Port</b>, <b>Root path</b> and transaction's <b>Sub path</b> properties.</li>\
  <li><i>Javelin connector</i>: replaces the address set in the <b>Connection address</b> property, made up of <b>Connection parameter</b>, <b>Host name</b>, host <b>Port</b> and <b>Connection type</b> sub properties.</li>\
 </ul>
