display_name=Write binary from Base64
short_description=Writes a binary file from a Base64 content. | \
 <p>The <i>Write binary from Base64</i> step allows writing a <code>Base64</code> content from a response XML in a binary file on the disk.</p>\
 <p>It can either create a new file or update an existing file, if a file of the same path and name already exists.</p>\
 <p>The file extension has to be defined: it corresponds to the type of binary file to write. It can be set in the <b>Output file</b> property, at the end of the file path.</p>\
 <p>A <code>Base64</code> content must be used as input, defined by the <b>Source</b> property. Such input content could be picked in output XML of transactions, for example:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>in an <i>SQL transaction</i> XML response: if the database contains a column with <code>Base64</code> data, this content would be present in transaction output,</li>\
  <li>etc.</li>\
 </ul>
