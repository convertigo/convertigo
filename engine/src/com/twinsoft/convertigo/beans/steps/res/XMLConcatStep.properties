display_name=Concat
short_description=Concatenates defined sources. | \
 <p><i>Concat</i> steps are used to concatenate string elements into one new resulting XML element inserted in the output.</p>\
 <p>The <i>Concat</i> step uses an array of input strings (set using the <b>Sources</b> property) to be concatenated. An optional <b>Separator</b> parameter can also be added. If used, the separator is inserted in the resulting string between each concatenated element.</p>\
 <p>The resulting string is added to the sequence XML output and can be used as a new source for other steps.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Convertigo Studio, when a <i>Concat</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>Element</i> step, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>Element</b>.</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>The <b>Node name</b> property remains the same.</li>\
  <li>The first source filled in the <i>Concat</i> step is moved to the <b>Source</b> property of the <i>Element</i> step.</li>\
  <li><b>Default value</b> properties defined in <i>Concat</i> step lines are concatenated and moved to the <b>Default value</b> property of the <i>Element</i> step.</li>\
 </ul>
property.separator.display_name=Separator
property.separator.short_description=Defines the text to be used as a separator string. | \
 <p>If set, this text is added between each text to concatenate. Default value is a white space, think about removing it if you do not want to use it.</p>
property.sourcesDefinition.display_name=Sources
property.sourcesDefinition.short_description=Defines a list of source items to use as values. | \
 <p>This property allows defining a list of source items that are used to create the result value. Each source item contains three columns to be set:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><b>Description</b>: Defines a comment or description about this source item.</li>\
  <li><b>Source</b>: Defines the source. A source is a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.</li>\
  <li><b>Default value</b>: Defines the default value for this source. If the source's XPath doesn't match in the referenced step or if the source is left blank, the default value is used. Otherwise, the source item creates no data.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>Each source item may define a source and a default value.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> A new source item can be added to the list using the blue keyboard icon. The source items defined in the list can be ordered using the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or deleted using the red cross icon.</p>
