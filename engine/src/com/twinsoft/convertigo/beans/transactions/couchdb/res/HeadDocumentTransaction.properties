display_name=HeadDocument
short_description=Returns the HTTP Headers containing a minimal amount of information about the specified document. |HEAD /{db}/{docid}<br/>\
The method supports the same query arguments as the GET /{db}/{docid} method, but only the header information (including document size, and the revision as an ETag), is returned.<br/>\
The ETag header shows the current revision for the requested document, and the Content-Length specifies the length of the data, if the document were requested in full.<br/>\
Adding any of the query arguments (see GET /{db}/{docid}), then the resulting HTTP Headers will correspond to what would be returned.<br/>\
