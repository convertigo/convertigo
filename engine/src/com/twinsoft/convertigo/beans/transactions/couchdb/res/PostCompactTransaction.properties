short_description=Request compaction of the specified database | \
 <p>POST /{db}/_compact</p>\
 <p>Compaction compresses the disk database file by performing the following operations:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Writes a new, optimized, version of the database file, removing any unused sections from the new version during write. Because a new file is temporarily created for this purpose, you may require up to twice the current storage space of the specified database in order for the compaction routine to complete.</li>\
  <li>Removes old revisions of documents from the database, up to the per-database limit specified by the _revs_limit database parameter.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>Compaction can only be requested on an individual database; you cannot compact all the databases for a CouchDB instance. The compaction process runs as a background process. <b>Response JSON Object:</b></p>\
 <ul>\
