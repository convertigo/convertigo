display_name=ResetDatabase
short_description=Resets the database. | Resets the specified database. All documents in the database will be deleted, all server based indexed \
views will also be deleted. When this transaction is executed, the FullSync database will automatically be versioned to a new \
Version tag. Any Convertigo SDK client syncing to this database will compare its current version tag to the the server version tag if \
they differ, the client will automatically RESET is local database to prevent any local document to flow back to the server.<br /><br />\
This implies that resetting a server database also automatically resets all client databases synced to this server database.
