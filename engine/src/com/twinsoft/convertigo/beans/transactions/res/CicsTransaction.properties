display_name=CICS transaction
short_description=Defines a CICS transaction. | A CICS Transaction Gateway can host several servers running different applications. In a CICS application, the display and business logics are usually managed in distinct programs. <br/>\
Programs exchange input and output data through a memoy pool called COMMAREA (COMMON AREA). The COMMAREA is usually mapped by a definition of COBOL data included in communicating programs. It can be stored as follows:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022  built in the source code of the CICS program,<br/>\
 \u2022  stored in a <span class="computer">copybook</span> separate file copied when compiling.<br/>\
<br/>\
From a Convertigo point of view, a CICS transaction represents a transaction executed by a given program of the server. Input (<span class="computer">inputMap</span>) and output (<span class="computer">outputMap</span>) data mapping COMMAREA definitions are defined in CICS transactions either manually or by importing data from a <span class="computer">copybook</span>.<br/>\
Parameters passed when executing the Convertigo transaction are mapped in the <span class="computer">inputMap</span> transmitted when calling the CICS transaction.<br/>\
The XML resulting from the Convertigo transaction execution corresponds to the <span class="computer">outputMap</span> returned by the CICS transaction. For more information, see the CICS connector object.
