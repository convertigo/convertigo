display_name=Javelin transaction
short_description=Defines an emulator-based transaction. | \
 <p>As regards legacy applications, Convertigo's basic principle is to:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>navigate through legacy screens,</li>\
  <li>detect defined screen classes,</li>\
  <li>extract legacy screen data in accordance with screen class-specific extraction rules,</li>\
  <li>treat extracted data in order to generate an XML document structured as required.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This process defines the notion of transaction. A transaction can be defined as a series of steps called statements. Statements are signaled by events. In other words, a transaction is made up of a set of event handlers, also called screen class handlers.</p>\
 <p>Screen transactions are written by the Convertigo programmer in plain JavaScript language. The programmer can therefore leverage the full power of the language while manipulating specific Convertigo objects, like <code>javelin</code> for accessing legacy screen funtionnality, <code>context</code> for accessing Convertigo useful information, <code>dom</code> for extended use and XML generation customization.</p>
property.timeoutForConnect.display_name=Connection timeout
property.timeoutForConnect.short_description=Defines the timeout for connecting to the host (in ms).
property.timeoutForDataStable.display_name=Data stable timeout
property.timeoutForDataStable.short_description=Defines the timeout for detecting stable screen (in ms).
property.dataStableThreshold.display_name=Datastable threshold
property.dataStableThreshold.short_description=Defines the inactivity time (in ms) before considering a screen fully built. | \
 <p>The datastable threshold is therefore lower than the stable screen waiting time (Videotex emulator: duration of net inactivity; SNA emulator: inactivity timeout for OIA indicator).</p>
property.onlyOnePage.display_name=Only one page
property.onlyOnePage.short_description=Defines whether data should be accumulated in one single page.
property.executeExtractionRulesInPanels.display_name=Execute extraction rules in panels
property.executeExtractionRulesInPanels.short_description=Defines whether extraction rules should be executed in panels.
property.removeBlocksNode.display_name=Remove 'blocks' nodes
property.removeBlocksNode.short_description=Defines whether encompassing "blocks" node should be removed (useful in web services context).
property.includedTagAttributes.display_name=XML attributes to include
property.includedTagAttributes.short_description=Defines, when applicable, the XML attributes to be included in the generated XML document. | \
 <p>These attributes are:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>Definition attributes: <code>name</code>, <code>type</code>;</li>\
  <li>Position attributes: <code>line</code>, <code>column</code>;</li>\
  <li>Color attributes: <code>foreground</code>, <code>background</code>;</li>\
  <li>Decoration attributes: <code>bold</code>, <code>underline</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>blink</code>;</li>\
  <li>Optional attributes.</li>\
 </ul>
