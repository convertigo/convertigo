display_name=JSON HTTP transaction
short_description=Defines a JSON-based HTTP transaction. | A <i>JSON HTTP transaction</i> is an HTTP transaction, allowing to perform an HTTP request and get the response back, for which responses are JSON-based. It is used to consume a JSON web service. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> <i>HTTP connector</i> supports OAuth authentication. To enable OAuth, you simply need to provide four variables to any kind of <i>HTTP transaction</i>: <span class="computer">__header_oAuthKey</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthSecret</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthToken</span> and <span class="computer">__header_oAuthTokenSecret</span>. For more information about OAuth in <i>HTTP connector</i>, refer to the following article in our Technical Blog: <i>http://www.convertigo.com/en/how-to/technical-blog/entry/using-oauth-with-convertigo-http-connector.html</i><br/>\
Dynamic parameter exists:<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">__header_[name]</span>: dynamically add a header <b>name</b>,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">__GET_[name]</span>: dynamically add a GET parameter <b>name</b>,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">__POST_[name]</span>: dynamically add a POST parameter <b>name</b>,<br/>
property.jsonEncoding.display_name=JSON response encoding
property.jsonEncoding.short_description=Defines the encoding of the JSON returned by the target server. | Default value is <span class="computer">UTF-8</span>. Depending on the target web service, the value has to be updated.
property.includeDataType.display_name=Include data type in XML response nodes
property.includeDataType.short_description=Defines if the JSON data type should be included in converted XML nodes. | Default value is <span class="computer">true</span>: data types are included in the XML nodes of the response as <span class="computer">type</span> attributes. <br/>\
Changing this property to <span class="computer">false</span> has as effect to not include the data types in XML nodes: the transaction response XML contains only data.
property.jsonArrayTranslationPolicy.display_name=JSON array translation policy
property.jsonArrayTranslationPolicy.short_description=Defines how JSON arrays should be translated to XML. | This property allows the Convertigo developer to choose how he wants the JSON arrays to be translated to XML. The need can be different depending on the source JSON web service.<br/>\
Possible options are: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">hierarchical</span>: full expanded mode, with sub nodes for array items, <br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">compact</span>: more compressed format with one node per array item, without encompassing array node. <br/>\
<br/>\
Default value is <span class="computer">hierarchical</span>.
