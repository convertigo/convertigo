display_name=Site Clipper transaction
short_description=Defines a transaction for a <i>Site Clipper connector</i>. | \
 <p>A <i>Site Clipper transaction</i> allows Convertigo to connect to a remote web server hosted at the URL defined in <b>Target URL</b> property.</p>\
 <p>Its execution does not return data from the target server, but specifies a redirection URL to its parent connector. This rewritten URL is an absolute URL pointing to the current Convertigo project, with a particular syntax:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>it starts with the usual project's path,</li>\
  <li>it then specifies the Convertigo context and the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> to use,</li>\
  <li>it ends with the <code>.siteclipper</code> extension,</li>\
  <li>after the extension, the target resource URL is concatenated, replacing the '<code>://</code>' symbols after the target resource protocol, <code>http://</code> for example, by a '<code>/</code>' character.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This gives the following URL form:</p>\
 <code>http://&lt;convertigo_server_host&gt;:&lt;convertigo_server_port&gt;/convertigo/projects/&lt;project_name&gt;/context=&lt;context_name&gt;,connector=&lt;connector_name&gt;.siteclipper/&lt;target_resource_protocol&gt;/&lt;target_resource_host&gt;/&lt;target_resource_URI&gt;</code>.\
 <p>The <i>Site Clipper connector</i> accessed thanks to this URL then relays all HTTP messages between the client and the target server.</p>\
 <p>To sum up, the <i>Site Clipper transaction</i> is used to initiate a site clipping process on a website, including the initialization of a context in the Convertigo server.</p>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> See <i>Site Clipper connector</i> and all related objects (<i>Screen class</i>, criteria, extraction rules,etc.) documentation for more information on how to manipulate the relayed HTTP data for site clipping purpose.</p>
property.targetURL.display_name=Target URL
property.targetURL.short_description=Defines the URL of a remote website to be clipped by Convertigo. | \
 <p>This property defines the URL to which connect when starting the site clipping process thanks to this transaction.</p>
