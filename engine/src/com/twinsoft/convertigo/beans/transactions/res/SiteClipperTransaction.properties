display_name=Site Clipper transaction
short_description=Defines a transaction for a <i>Site Clipper connector</i>. | A <i>Site Clipper transaction</i> allows Convertigo to connect to a remote web server hosted at the URL defined in <b>Target URL</b> property. <br/>\
Its execution does not return data from the target server, but specifies a redirection URL to its parent connector. This rewritten URL is an absolute URL pointing to the current Convertigo project, with a particular syntax:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 it starts with the usual project's path, <br/>\
 \u2022 it then specifies the Convertigo context and the <i>Site Clipper connector</i> to use, <br/>\
 \u2022 it ends with the <span class="computer">.siteclipper</span> extension, <br/>\
 \u2022 after the extension, the target resource URL is concatenated, replacing the '<span class="computer">://</span>' symbols after the target resource protocol, <span class="computer">http://</span> for example, by a '<span class="computer">/</span>' character. <br/>\
<br/>\
This gives the following URL form: <br/>\
<span class="computer">http://&lt;convertigo_server_host&gt;:&lt;convertigo_server_port&gt;/convertigo/projects/&lt;project_name&gt;/context=&lt;context_name&gt;,connector=&lt;connector_name&gt;.siteclipper/&lt;target_resource_protocol&gt;/&lt;target_resource_host&gt;/&lt;target_resource_URI&gt;</span>. <br/>\
The <i>Site Clipper connector</i> accessed thanks to this URL then relays all HTTP messages between the client and the target server. <br/>\
To sum up, the <i>Site Clipper transaction</i> is used to initiate a site clipping process on a website, including the initialization of a context in the Convertigo server. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> See <i>Site Clipper connector</i> and all related objects (<i>Screen class</i>, criteria, extraction rules,etc.) documentation for more information on how to manipulate the relayed HTTP data for site clipping purpose.
