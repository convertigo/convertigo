display_name=XML HTTP transaction
short_description=Defines an XML-based HTTP transaction. | An <i>XML HTTP transaction</i> is an HTTP transaction, allowing to perform an HTTP request and get the response back, for which responses are XML-based. It is used to call a REST or SOAP web service which responses are XML-based. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> <i>HTTP connector</i> supports OAuth authentication. To enable OAuth, you simply need to provide four variables to any kind of <i>HTTP transaction</i>: <span class="computer">__header_oAuthKey</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthSecret</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthToken</span> and <span class="computer">__header_oAuthTokenSecret</span>. For more information about OAuth in <i>HTTP connector</i>, refer to the following article in our Technical Blog: <i>http://www.convertigo.com/en/how-to/technical-blog/entry/using-oauth-with-convertigo-http-connector.html</i><br/>\
Dynamic parameter exists:<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">__header_[name]</span>: dynamically add a header <b>name</b>,<br/>\
 \u2022 <span class="computer">__GET_[name]</span>: dynamically add a GET parameter <b>name</b>,<br/>\

property.responseElementQName.display_name=Schema of response's RPC call 
property.responseElementQName.short_description=Defines the schema of the RPC call response. Only used in case of auto-generated transaction when importing a WSDL. | When importing a remote web service thanks to its WSDL to create a project, each transaction allows invoking a method of the target web service. Each method already has a schema defined in the web service. This property allows to reference the name of this schema type to reuse it in transaction output XML schema. <br/>\
We advise not to manually update this property has it is mainly used for automatically created transactions.
