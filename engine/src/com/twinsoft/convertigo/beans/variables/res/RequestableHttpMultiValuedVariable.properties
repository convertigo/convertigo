display_name=HTTP multi-valued variable
short_description=Defines a multi-valued variable for an HTTP-based transaction. | An <i>HTTP multi-valued variable</i> declares a variable which accepts one or more values to an HTTP-based transaction. <br/>\
This variable is dedicated to HTTP-based transactions only: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <i>HTTP transaction</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>XML HTTP transaction</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>JSON HTTP transaction</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>HTML transaction</i>. <br/>\
<br/>\
This variable object allows defining HTTP request parameters through the <b>HTTP name</b> and <b>HTTP method</b> properties. <br/>\
It can define a default list of value(s), specified in the <b>Default value</b> property, that are used as HTTP parameters values if no value is found for this variable. <br/>\
At runtime, the HTTP parameters values are calculated by Convertigo through the following steps: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the values are received in the request to the transaction, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no value is received for this variable, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context (this JavaScript variable should be an array of values), <br/>\
 \u2022 if no JavaScript value is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name is stored in current context, <br/>\
 \u2022 if none of the previous methods gives values, the default list of values is used, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no default value is specified, the variable is not defined and an Exception can be thrown when trying to access its values in the core of the transaction. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>HTTP multi-valued variable</i> is created in a transaction/sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>HTTP single-valued variable</i>, using the right-click menu on the variable and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>SingleValued variable</b>. <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>HTTP connector</i> supports OAuth authentication. To enable OAuth, you simply need to provide four variables to any kind of <i>HTTP transaction</i>: <span class="computer">__header_oAuthKey</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthSecret</span>, <span class="computer">__header_oAuthToken</span> and <span class="computer">__header_oAuthTokenSecret</span>. For more information about OAuth in <i>HTTP connector</i>, refer to the following article in our Technical Blog: <i>http://www.convertigo.com/en/how-to/technical-blog/entry/using-oauth-with-convertigo-http-connector.html</i><br/>
