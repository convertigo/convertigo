display_name=HTTP multi-valued variable
short_description=Defines a multi-valued variable for an HTTP-based transaction. | \
 <p>An <i>HTTP multi-valued variable</i> declares a variable which accepts one or more values to an HTTP-based transaction.</p>\
 <p>This variable is dedicated to HTTP-based transactions only:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><i>HTTP transaction</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>XML HTTP transaction</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>JSON HTTP transaction</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>HTML transaction</i>.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This variable object allows defining HTTP request parameters through the <b>HTTP name</b> and <b>HTTP method</b> properties.</p>\
 <p>It can define a default list of value(s), specified in the <b>Default value</b> property, that are used as HTTP parameters values if no value is found for this variable.</p>\
 <p>At runtime, the HTTP parameters values are calculated by Convertigo through the following steps:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>the values are received in the request to the transaction,</li>\
  <li>if no value is received for this variable, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context (this JavaScript variable should be an array of values),</li>\
  <li>if no JavaScript value is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name is stored in current context,</li>\
  <li>if none of the previous methods gives values, the default list of values is used,</li>\
  <li>if no default value is specified, the variable is not defined and an Exception can be thrown when trying to access its values in the core of the transaction.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>HTTP multi-valued variable</i> is created in a transaction/sequence, it can be easily replaced by an <i>HTTP single-valued variable</i>, using the right-click menu on the variable and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>SingleValued variable</b>.</li>\
  <li><i>HTTP connector</i> supports OAuth authentication. To enable OAuth, you simply need to provide four variables to any kind of <i>HTTP transaction</i>: <code>__header_oAuthKey</code>, <code>__header_oAuthSecret</code>, <code>__header_oAuthToken</code> and <code>__header_oAuthTokenSecret</code>. For more information about OAuth in <i>HTTP connector</i>, refer to the following article in our Technical Blog: <i>http://www.convertigo.com/en/how-to/technical-blog/entry/using-oauth-with-convertigo-http-connector.html</i></li>\
 </ul>
