display_name=Request multi-valued variable
short_description=Defines a multi-valued variable for a transaction/sequence. | \
 <p>A <i>Request multi-valued variable</i> declares a variable which accepts one or more values to a transaction/sequence.</p>\
 <p>This variable is dedicated to the following transaction/sequence objects, except for HTTP-based transactions which use more specific variables:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li><i>Generic Sequence</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>Javelin transaction</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>SQL transaction</i>,</li>\
  <li><i>Site Clipper transaction</i>.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p>This variable object can define a default list of value(s), specified in the <b>Default value</b> property, that is used if no value is is found for this variable.</p>\
 <p>At runtime, the variable values are calculated by Convertigo through the following steps:</p>\
 <ul>\
  <li>the values are received in the request to the transaction/sequence,</li>\
  <li>if no value is received for this variable, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context (this JavaScript variable should be an array of values),</li>\
  <li>if no JavaScript value is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name is stored in current context,</li>\
  <li>if none of the previous methods gives values, the default list of values is used,</li>\
  <li>if no default value is specified, the variable is not defined and an Exception can be thrown when trying to access its values in the core of the transaction/sequence.</li>\
 </ul>\
 <p><strong>Note:</strong> In Convertigo Studio, when a <i>Request multi-valued variable</i> is created in a transaction/sequence, it can be easily replaced by a <i>Request single-valued variable</i>, using the right-click menu on the variable and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>SingleValued variable</b>.</p>
