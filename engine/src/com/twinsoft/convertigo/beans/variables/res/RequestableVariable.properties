display_name=Request single-valued variable
short_description=Defines a single-valued variable for a transaction/sequence. | A <i>Request single-valued variable</i> declares a variable which accepts a unique value to a transaction/sequence. <br/>\
This variable is dedicated to the following transaction/sequence objects, except for HTTP-based transactions which use more specific variables:\
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Generic Sequence</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Javelin transaction</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>SQL transaction</i>, <br/>\
 \u2022 <i>Site Clipper transaction</i>. <br/>\
<br/>\
This variable object can define a default value, specified in the <b>Default value</b> property, that is used if no value is found for this variable. <br/>\
At runtime, the variable value is calculated by Convertigo through the following steps: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 the value is received in the request to the transaction/sequence, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no value is received for this variable, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no JavaScript value is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name is stored in current context, <br/>\
 \u2022 if none of the previous methods gives a value, the default value is used, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no default value is specified, the variable is not defined and an Exception can be thrown when trying to access its value in the core of the transaction/sequence. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when a <i>Request single-valued variable</i> is created in a transaction/sequence, it can be easily replaced by a <i>Request multi-valued variable</i>, using the right-click menu on the variable and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>MultiValued variable</b>.
property.wsdl.display_name=WSDL exposed
property.wsdl.short_description=Defines whether the variable is exposed in web service. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, variable definition is inserted in the project's WSDL as a method parameter. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> The <b>Accessibility</b> property of the parent transaction (or sequence) defines how the method itself is exposed in the web service.
property.personalizable.display_name=Customizable
property.personalizable.short_description=Defines whether the variable is customizable. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the variable is used as a customizable preference field in the widget generated from the parent transaction (or sequence) in Convertigo Mashup Composer or any other portal. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This property is used when applicable, i.e. when the widget is declared in a portal including customizable preference fields feature.
property.cachedKey.display_name=Cache key
property.cachedKey.short_description=Defines whether the variable should be part of the cache key. | If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the variable and its value are added to the cache key which is used to determine whether the transaction's response (or sequence's response) should be pulled from the cache or not. <br/>\
A transaction's cached response (or sequence's cached response) is pulled from the cache when all cache key values are corresponding to a stored cache entry (may contain other data that variables, for example the certificate group defined by some transactions).
property.schemaType.display_name=Schema type
property.schemaType.short_description=Defines the XML schema data type of the variable for web service. | This property allows choosing the appropriate XML schema data type for the variable. XSM schema data types are defined in W3C documentation at: <span class="computer">http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema</span>. 
property.isFileUpload.display_name=Is a file upload
property.isFileUpload.short_description=Defines whether the variable is an uploaded file. | When set to <span class="computer">true</span>, this property indicates that the transaction/sequence should receive an uploaded file in this variable. <br/>\
When received, the uploaded file is stored in a temporary folder and deleted at the end of the transaction/sequence. In the transaction/sequence execution context, the variable contains the path of the temporary file. <br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This property value is used only by the <i>Test Platform</i> to allow the developer testing the transaction/sequence. When receiving a multi-part request, Convertigo can set any variable as an uploaded file.
property.xmlTypeAffectation.display_name=Schema type QName
property.xmlTypeAffectation.short_description=Assigned schema type qualified name
