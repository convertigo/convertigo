display_name=Call Single-Valued Variable
short_description=Defines a single-valued variable for a step. | A <i>Call single-valued variable</i> is used to send a single-valued <span class="computer">input</span> variable to a transaction/sequence targeted by a <i>Call Transaction</i>/<i>Call Sequence</i> step. <br/>\
It can define a default value, specified in the <b>Default value</b> property, that is used as parameter value if no value is found for this variable. <br/>\
At runtime, the variable value is calculated by Convertigo through the following steps: \
<br/><br/>\
 \u2022 if the <b>Source</b> property is set, the variable value is the source result (see <b>Source</b> property documentation), <br/>\
 \u2022 if no source is set, the JavaScript value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name exists in the JavaScript scope of current context, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no JavaScript variable is defined, the context value of the variable is chosen, if a variable of the same name is stored in current context, <br/>\
 \u2022 if none of the previous methods gives a value, the default value set in the <b>Default value</b> property is used, <br/>\
 \u2022 if no default value is specified, the variable is not sent to the target transaction/sequence. <br/>\
<br/>\
<span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In Convertigo Studio, when a <i>Call single-valued variable</i> is created in a <i>Call Transaction</i>/<i>Call Sequence</i> step, it can be easily replaced by a <i>Call multi-valued variable</i>, using the right-click menu on the variable and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>MultiValued variable</b>.
property.sourceDefinition.display_name=Source
property.sourceDefinition.short_description=Defines the source to use as variable value. | This property allows defining the variable value as a source from a previous step. <br/>\
A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and the variable takes for value the XML node value resulting from this execution (the variable value will be its text content). <br/>\
If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the variable value is calculated as explained in the main description of this object.
